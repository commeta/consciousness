## Abstract

This paper presents the Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) Theory, proposing that consciousness arises from processes that integrate information through recurrent neural networks. A new key parameter‚ÄîEmergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë )‚Äîis introduced, accounting for the quantity and quality of integrated information within the context of recurrent processing. The theory is supported by neuroimaging data and experimental studies involving visual masking. Additionally, new physical quantities are introduced to describe the degree of integration of quantum information and recurrence in spacetime, potentially impacting modern cosmological models.

## Keywords

Emergent integration, recurrent mapping, consciousness, neural networks, quantum information, cosmology.

## 1. Introduction

Consciousness remains one of the most enigmatic and challenging phenomena to study in science. Existing theories attempt to explain its nature, yet no unified approach has been established. This work proposes the Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) Theory, asserting that consciousness emerges from processes that integrate information through recurrent neural networks.

EIRM bridges neurobiological and physical aspects, offering a novel perspective on the nature of consciousness and its connection to fundamental processes in cosmology. This opens opportunities for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of neurobiology, quantum physics, and cosmology.

## 2. Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM)

### 2.1. Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë )

The key parameter of EIRM is the Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë ), which defines the degree of conscious perception through the integration and recurrent processing of information:

`
Œ¶‚Çë = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) I_(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R_(recurrence)(t)dt,
`

where:

- I_(integration)(t)  is the degree of information unification at time  t .

- R_(recurrence)(t)  is the degree of recurrent processing at time  t .

This formulation emphasizes that both the integration of information and its recurrent processing are essential for the emergence of consciousness.

### 2.2. State Equations of Neuronal Dynamic Systems

The behavior of neural networks can be described using state equations:

`
dùê± / dt = ùêü(ùê±(t), ùêÆ(t), W),
`

where:

- ùê±(t)  is the vector of the network's state at time  t .

- ùêÆ(t)  represents input signals.

- W  is the weight matrix, including recurrent connections.

These equations capture the dynamic evolution of neuronal states influenced by inputs and the network's inherent structure, highlighting the role of recurrent connections in information processing.

### 2.3. Bayesian Updating of Predictive Models

Predictive models in the brain are updated through Bayesian inference:

`
P(Œ∏ | D) = P(D | Œ∏) ‚ãÖ P(Œ∏) / P(D),
`

where:

- Œ∏  represents the model parameters.

- D  denotes observed data.

- P(Œ∏ | D)  is the posterior probability of the parameters given the data.

This mechanism allows the brain to continually refine its internal models based on new information, a process integral to perception and consciousness.

## 3. Experimental Evidence

### 3.1. Neuroimaging Data

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that conscious states are associated with increased activity in recurrent neural circuits. Conversely, disruptions in consciousness, such as in coma or general anesthesia, correlate with a significant reduction in this recurrent activity [1][2].

### 3.2. Visual Masking Experiments

In visual masking experiments, interrupting recurrent processing prevents the conscious awareness of a presented stimulus, despite its initial processing [3]. This demonstrates the critical role of recurrent connections in conscious perception.

## 4. Application of EIRM in Cosmology

### 4.1. Integration of Quantum Information in Spacetime

To describe the integration of quantum information and recurrence in cosmology, new physical quantities are introduced:

- Density of Integrated Quantum Information ( œÅ_(IQI) ):

This quantity characterizes the amount of quantum information integrated per unit volume of spacetime:
  
`
œÅ_(IQI) = lim(Œî V ‚Üí 0) Œî I / Œî V,
`

where  Œî I  is the change in integrated information within the volume  Œî V .

- Recurrence Parameter ( R ):

This parameter characterizes the degree of recurrent interactions of quantum states in the spacetime continuum. It can be related to the probability of repeated quantum interactions or to the topological features of recurrent structures.

### 4.2. Effective Equation of State

Introducing these new parameters allows for defining an effective equation of state for dark energy, dependent on  œÅ_(IQI)  and  R :

`
w_(eff) = w‚ÇÄ + w‚ÇÅ f(œÅ_(IQI), R),
`

where:

- w‚ÇÄ  and  w‚ÇÅ  are constants of the model.

- f(œÅ_(IQI), R)  is a function describing the influence of integrated information and recurrence on cosmological dynamics.

This approach suggests that the emergence of consciousness and integration of information could have macroscopic effects on the universe's expansion.

### 4.3. Influence on Spacetime Metric

The new parameters can be incorporated into modified Einstein field equations:

`
G_(ŒºŒΩ) + Œõ g_(ŒºŒΩ) = 8œÄ G (( T_(ŒºŒΩ) + T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI) )),
`

where:

- G_(ŒºŒΩ)  is the Einstein tensor.

- Œõ  is the cosmological constant.

- T_(ŒºŒΩ)  is the stress-energy tensor of ordinary matter.

- T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI)  is the stress-energy tensor associated with integrated quantum information and recurrent effects.

This modification implies that information integration processes could contribute to the overall energy content influencing spacetime curvature.

## 5. Discussion

The proposed EIRM Theory unifies concepts from neurobiology and cosmology, offering a novel approach to understanding consciousness and its connection to fundamental processes in the universe. The introduction of  œÅ_(IQI)  and  R  may significantly impact modern cosmological models, particularly concerning the nature of dark energy and the structure of the spacetime continuum.

Further research is needed to quantify the influence of these new quantities on cosmological observations and to develop more precise models that can be empirically tested.

## 6. Conclusion

- Emergence of Consciousness: EIRM Theory proposes a new mechanism for the emergence of consciousness through processes of emergent integration and recurrent mapping in neural networks.

- Experimental Support: Neuroimaging data and studies involving visual masking support the core principles of the theory.

- Cosmological Implications: Extending EIRM into cosmology opens new perspectives for understanding the interaction of quantum information integration and the universe's structure.

- Future Work: Further investigations are necessary to assess the quantitative effects of the new parameters on cosmological dynamics and to refine the theoretical framework.

## Appendix A

Additional Mathematical Derivations

### A.1. Detailed Derivation of Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë )

Considering the continuous integration over time,  Œ¶‚Çë  captures the cumulative effect of integration and recurrence:

Œ¶‚Çë = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) I_(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R_(recurrence)(t)dt = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) œÜ(t)dt,


where  œÜ(t) = I(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R(recurrence)(t)  represents the instantaneous emergent integrated information.

### A.2. Relation to Neural Complexity Measures

The concept of  Œ¶‚Çë  is related to measures of neural complexity, such as Tononi's integrated information  Œ¶ . However,  Œ¶‚Çë  explicitly incorporates recurrent processing, emphasizing its role in consciousness.
