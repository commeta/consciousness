### Abstract

We propose a unified theoretical framework ‚Äî the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) ‚Äî which posits that consciousness arises from processes that integrate information through recurrent neural networks, and extend these principles to cosmology. By introducing new physical quantities such as the Density of Integrated Quantum Information (œÅ<sub>IQI</sub>), we modify Einstein's equations to incorporate the effects of integrated quantum information and recurrent interactions on the fabric of spacetime. This approach offers novel insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy as emergent phenomena resulting from informational processes on cosmic scales. We present the mathematical formulations underpinning EIRM, discuss its implications for neuroscience and cosmology, and suggest experimental approaches for validation.

### Keywords

### 1. Introduction

Understanding the nature of consciousness and the fundamental properties of the Universe are among the most profound challenges in science. Traditionally, these domains have been treated separately; however, recent advances suggest that information processing plays a critical role in both neural and cosmic systems. In this paper, we introduce the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), which unifies concepts from neuroscience and cosmology through the lens of information theory and quantum mechanics.

EIRM asserts that consciousness emerges from the integration of information via recurrent neural networks in the brain. Extending this concept to cosmology, we propose that spacetime itself exhibits recurrent informational interactions at the quantum level, which influence its geometry and dynamics. By introducing new physical quantities and modifying the Einstein field equations, we aim to provide a coherent framework that accounts for dark matter and dark energy as emergent properties of integrated quantum information.

### 2. Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM)

#### 2.1. Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë )

The key parameter of EIRM is the Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë ), which defines the degree of conscious perception through the integration and recurrent processing of information:

`
Œ¶‚Çë = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) I_(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R_(recurrence)(t)dt,
`

where:

- `I_(integration)(t)`  is the degree of information unification at time  t .

- `R_(recurrence)(t)`  is the degree of recurrent processing at time  t .

This formulation emphasizes that both the integration of information and its recurrent processing are essential for the emergence of consciousness.

#### 2.2. State Equations of Neuronal Dynamic Systems

The behavior of neural networks can be described using state equations:

`
dùê± / dt = ùêü(ùê±(t), ùêÆ(t), W),
`

where:

- `ùê±(t)`  is the vector of the network's state at time  t .

- `ùêÆ(t)`  represents input signals.

- `W`  is the weight matrix, including recurrent connections.

These equations capture the dynamic evolution of neuronal states influenced by inputs and the network's inherent structure, highlighting the role of recurrent connections in information processing.

#### 2.3. Bayesian Updating of Predictive Models

Predictive models in the brain are updated through Bayesian inference:

`
P(Œ∏ | D) = P(D | Œ∏) ‚ãÖ P(Œ∏) / P(D),
`

where:

- `Œ∏`  represents the model parameters.

- `D`  denotes observed data.

- `P(Œ∏ | D)`  is the posterior probability of the parameters given the data.

This mechanism allows the brain to continually refine its internal models based on new information, a process integral to perception and consciousness.

### 3. Experimental Evidence

#### 3.1. Neuroimaging Data

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that conscious states are associated with increased activity in recurrent neural circuits. Conversely, disruptions in consciousness, such as in coma or general anesthesia, correlate with a significant reduction in this recurrent activity [1][2].

#### 3.2. Visual Masking Experiments

In visual masking experiments, interrupting recurrent processing prevents the conscious awareness of a presented stimulus, despite its initial processing [3]. This demonstrates the critical role of recurrent connections in conscious perception.

### 4. Application of EIRM in Cosmology

#### 4.1. Integration of Quantum Information in Spacetime

To describe the integration of quantum information and recurrence in cosmology, new physical quantities are introduced:

- Density of Integrated Quantum Information `( œÅ_(IQI) )`:

This quantity characterizes the amount of quantum information integrated per unit volume of spacetime:
  
`
œÅ_(IQI) = lim(Œî V ‚Üí 0) Œî I / Œî V,
`

where  `Œî I`  is the change in integrated information within the volume  `Œî V` .

- Recurrence Parameter ( R ):

This parameter characterizes the degree of recurrent interactions of quantum states in the spacetime continuum. It can be related to the probability of repeated quantum interactions or to the topological features of recurrent structures.

#### 4.2. Effective Equation of State

Introducing these new parameters allows for defining an effective equation of state for dark energy, dependent on  œÅ_(IQI)  and  R :

`
w_(eff) = w‚ÇÄ + w‚ÇÅ f(œÅ_(IQI), R),
`

where:

- w‚ÇÄ  and  w‚ÇÅ  are constants of the model.

- `f(œÅ_(IQI), R)`  is a function describing the influence of integrated information and recurrence on cosmological dynamics.

This approach suggests that the emergence of consciousness and integration of information could have macroscopic effects on the universe's expansion.

#### 4.3. Influence on Spacetime Metric

The new parameters can be incorporated into modified Einstein field equations:

`
G_(ŒºŒΩ) + Œõ g_(ŒºŒΩ) = 8œÄ G (( T_(ŒºŒΩ) + T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI) )),
`

where:

- `G_(ŒºŒΩ)`  is the Einstein tensor.

- `Œõ`  is the cosmological constant.

- `T_(ŒºŒΩ)`  is the stress-energy tensor of ordinary matter.

- `T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI)`  is the stress-energy tensor associated with integrated quantum information and recurrent effects.

This modification implies that information integration processes could contribute to the overall energy content influencing spacetime curvature.


#### 4.4. Operators of Integration and Recurrence

We describe the state of the Universe using operators representing information integration ( ^I ) and recurrent mapping ( ^R ):

`Œ® = ^I ^R ùìò,`


where:

- `Œ®`  is the state vector of the Universe in spacetime.

- `ùìò`  is the initial informational state.

- `^I`  is the operator of information integration.

- `^R`  is the operator of recurrent transformations between quantum states.

#### 4.5. Integration into Quantum Field Theory

The scalar field  `Œ¶_q(x)`  can be incorporated into the Lagrangian density of the quantum field theory governing spacetime:

`ùìõ = ùìõ_(GR) + ùìõ_Œ¶,`


where:

- `ùìõ_(GR)`  is the standard Lagrangian density for general relativity.

- `ùìõŒ¶`  includes terms involving  Œ¶q(x)  and its interactions.

#### 4.6. Modified Expression for Entropy

Taking into account the new concept of emergent information, we can propose a modified expression for entropy that considers the contribution of this information to the thermodynamic properties of the system:

`S_(eff) = k_B ln W - Œª Œ¶‚Çë,`

where:

- `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, relating temperature and energy.

- `W` is the number of microstates of the system.

- `Œª` is a coefficient characterizing the contribution of emergent information to entropy.

- `Œ¶‚Çë` is a measure of emergent information.

This expression implies that emergent information can have a significant impact on the thermodynamic properties of systems, which may be particularly relevant in the context of complex systems and processes related to consciousness.


#### 4.7. Modified Commutation Relation

We propose to modify the standard commutation relation as follows:

`[^x, ^p] = i‚Ñè (1 + f(Œ¶‚Çë)),`

where:

- `f(Œ¶‚Çë)` is a function describing the influence of emergent integrated information on the commutation of operators.

This modification suggests that with a high degree of information integration and recurrence in a system, additional correlations may arise that are not accounted for in standard quantum mechanics. These correlations could lead to changes in the spectrum of operators and, consequently, in their commutation relations.

Mathematical Consideration

For quantum systems with recurrent interactions, a corrective term can be introduced into the commutation relation:

`[^x, ^p] = i‚Ñè + iŒª Œ¶‚Çë,`

where:

- `Œª` is a proportionality constant determined by the properties of the system.

This approach indicates that emergent information could play a significant role in the fundamental structure of quantum mechanics, potentially leading to new insights in the behavior of quantum systems.


### 5. Discussion

The proposed EIRM Theory unifies concepts from neurobiology and cosmology, offering a novel approach to understanding consciousness and its connection to fundamental processes in the universe. The introduction of  œÅ_(IQI)  and  R  may significantly impact modern cosmological models, particularly concerning the nature of dark energy and the structure of the spacetime continuum.

Further research is needed to quantify the influence of these new quantities on cosmological observations and to develop more precise models that can be empirically tested.

### 6. Conclusion

- Emergence of Consciousness: EIRM Theory proposes a new mechanism for the emergence of consciousness through processes of emergent integration and recurrent mapping in neural networks.

- Experimental Support: Neuroimaging data and studies involving visual masking support the core principles of the theory.

- Cosmological Implications: Extending EIRM into cosmology opens new perspectives for understanding the interaction of quantum information integration and the universe's structure.

- Future Work: Further investigations are necessary to assess the quantitative effects of the new parameters on cosmological dynamics and to refine the theoretical framework.

### Appendix A

Additional Mathematical Derivations

#### A.1. Detailed Derivation of Emergent Integrated Information ( Œ¶‚Çë )

Considering the continuous integration over time,  Œ¶‚Çë  captures the cumulative effect of integration and recurrence:

Œ¶‚Çë = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) I_(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R_(recurrence)(t)dt = ‚à´‚ÇÄ^(t‚ÇÅ) œÜ(t)dt,


where  œÜ(t) = I(integration)(t) ‚ãÖ R(recurrence)(t)  represents the instantaneous emergent integrated information.

#### A.2. Relation to Neural Complexity Measures

The concept of  Œ¶‚Çë  is related to measures of neural complexity, such as Tononi's integrated information  Œ¶ . However,  Œ¶‚Çë  explicitly incorporates recurrent processing, emphasizing its role in consciousness.
