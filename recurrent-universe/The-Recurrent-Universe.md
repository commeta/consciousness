# The Theory of the Recurrent Universe: A New Paradigm in Cosmology

## Introduction

Modern cosmology faces a number of fundamental challenges related to the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the origin of the Universe. The traditional standard model of cosmology, based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, despite its successes, cannot provide comprehensive answers to these questions. In the search for new theoretical approaches, increasing attention is being paid to the role of information and quantum effects in the formation of the structure of space-time.

The Theory of the Recurrent Universe offers a revolutionary view of cosmology, combining concepts from quantum mechanics, information theory, and nonlinear dynamics. In this model, recurrent processes and integrated quantum information are considered as key factors determining the geometry and evolution of the Universe. This approach opens new perspectives for solving long-standing problems, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, as well as the origin of space-time.

This work presents a comprehensive study of the Theory of the Recurrent Universe, revealing its mathematical foundations, connections with other advanced theories, and experimental predictions.

### Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics and General Theory of Relativity

#### Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. The key principles of quantum mechanics include:

1. Quantization: Physical quantities, such as energy, can only take on discrete values, not arbitrary ones.
2. Wave function: The state of a quantum system is described by a wave function, which contains all available information about the system.
3. Uncertainty principle: It is impossible to simultaneously measure certain pairs of physical quantities, such as position and momentum, with arbitrary precision.
4. Superposition: A quantum system can be in a linear combination (superposition) of multiple possible states at the same time.
5. Quantum entanglement: The states of multiple quantum objects can be strongly correlated, even if they are spatially separated.

These unique properties of quantum systems underlie many modern technologies, such as quantum computers and cryptography.

#### General Theory of Relativity

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR) is a fundamental theory of gravity that describes gravity as a curvature of space-time. The key concepts of GR include:

1. Space-time: Space and time are united into a single four-dimensional structure called space-time.
2. Curvature of space-time: Massive objects curve the space-time, which manifests as gravitational attraction.
3. Einstein's field equations: Mathematical equations that relate the geometry of space-time to the distribution of matter and energy.
4. Gravitational waves: Disturbances in the space-time that propagate at the speed of light, predicted by GR and experimentally confirmed.
5. Black holes: Regions of space-time with such strong gravity that nothing, including light, can escape from them.

GR revolutionized our understanding of gravity and cosmology, replacing Newton's theory of gravity with a more fundamental description.

#### Connection between Quantum Mechanics and General Theory of Relativity

Despite their tremendous successes, quantum mechanics and GR have not yet been unified into a single theory. Attempts to unify these two theories have led to the emergence of concepts such as:

1. Quantum gravity: Theoretical models that try to describe gravity in terms of quantum principles, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity.
2. Holographic principle: The idea that all the information contained in a volume can be encoded on its two-dimensional boundary.
3. Entropic gravity: The notion that gravity may arise as a statistical effect related to the information encoded on event horizons.

The search for a consistent theory that unifies quantum mechanics and GR remains one of the major unsolved problems in modern physics. New cosmological models, such as the theory of the Recurrent Universe, aim to contribute to this direction.




#### New Cosmological Models

New cosmological models, such as the theory of the Recurrent Universe, introduce several important changes and additions in the context of quantum mechanics and general relativity:

1. Integrated Quantum Information:
   - A new physical quantity is introduced - the density of integrated quantum information (œÅ_IQI), which characterizes the amount and quality of quantum information combined in spacetime.
   - This parameter influences the geometry and dynamics of spacetime, allowing the explanation of dark matter and dark energy without the introduction of additional hypothetical components.

2. Recurrence:
   - Recurrent processes, where the states of the system cyclically affect their further evolution, are considered as a fundamental principle.
   - A recurrence parameter (R) is introduced, which characterizes the degree and intensity of such recurring quantum interactions.
   - Recurrence, together with integrated information, affect the dynamics of spacetime.

3. Modification of Einstein's Equations:
   - Einstein's equations are modified to account for the contribution of integrated quantum information and recurrent effects.
   - An additional energy-momentum tensor, associated with these information parameters, is introduced, which affects the curvature of spacetime.

4. Avoidance of Singularity:
   - Recurrent processes and integrated quantum information can lead to a "bounce" of the Universe, preventing the occurrence of a singularity within the framework of general relativity.
   - Instead of the Big Bang, a scenario of the emergent origin of spacetime is proposed.

5. Evolution of the Universe:
   - The model predicts a smooth transition from accelerated expansion to a regime dominated by ordinary matter and radiation.
   - Accelerated expansion can be explained without the introduction of a cosmological constant or dark energy.

Thus, new cosmological models, such as the theory of the Recurrent Universe, introduce significant changes in our understanding of the fundamental relationships between quantum mechanics, information, and the geometry of spacetime. This opens new perspectives for the unification of quantum physics and general relativity.


### Connection with the "It from Bit" and Holographic Principle

The proposed theory of the Recurrent Universe has close connections with two important concepts in modern physics:

#### "It from Bit"

The "It from Bit" idea (John Archibald Wheeler) postulates that the fundamental reality of the Universe can be described in terms of information, rather than in traditional physical concepts of matter and energy. According to this approach, all physical objects and phenomena, including space-time, are derived from some primary informational field.

Within the framework of the Recurrent Universe theory, the primary informational field (denoted as ùìò) is considered as the fundamental basis of reality, containing all possible quantum states and their potential interactions. The evolution of this informational field is described using the operators of information integration (^I) and recurrent mapping (^R):

`Œ® = ^I ^R ùìò`

Where Œ® is the state of the Universe in space-time. Thus, the Recurrent Universe theory develops the ideas of "It from Bit", linking the emergence of spatial-temporal properties to fundamental informational processes.

#### Holographic Principle

The Holographic Principle (Gerard 't Hooft, Leonard Susskind) states that all the information contained in a volume of space-time can be encoded on its boundary. This implies a deep connection between information and the geometry of space-time.

In the Recurrent Universe theory, the emergence of spatial-temporal properties is also considered as a result of information integration and recurrence processes. New physical quantities, such as the density of integrated quantum information (œÅ_(IQI)) and the recurrence parameter (R), are introduced to describe these informational processes and their influence on the space-time metric.

The modification of the Einstein equations by including the energy-momentum tensor associated with the integrated quantum information (T^(IQI)_(ŒºŒΩ)) demonstrates how informational parameters can be directly linked to the geometry of space-time. Thus, the Recurrent Universe theory is in agreement with the Holographic Principle and the idea of the fundamental role of information in the structure of reality.

The integration of the concepts of "It from Bit" and the Holographic Principle with the mechanisms of information integration and recurrence lies at the core of the Recurrent Universe theory, opening new perspectives for understanding the nature of space-time and its dynamics.




### Complex Systems Theory and Emergent Properties of Recurrent Processes

Complex systems theory provides a powerful framework for understanding how emergent properties can arise from recurrent processes. Complex systems are characterized by the presence of many interacting components, nonlinear feedback loops, and the ability to self-organize. In such systems, simple rules at the micro-level can lead to the emergence of complex, unpredictable patterns at the macro-level.

#### Recurrence and Emergence

A key aspect of complex systems theory is the concept of recurrence. Recurrent processes, where the states of a system cyclically influence their own further evolution, lie at the heart of many emergent phenomena. For example:

1. Cellular Automata: Simple rules for updating cells in a cellular automaton can lead to the emergence of complex, fractal-like structures.
2. Neural Networks: Recurrent connections between neurons allow neural networks to exhibit emergent properties such as learning, pattern recognition, and the generation of new ideas.
3. Ecosystems: Complex interactions between species in an ecosystem, including predator-prey and symbiotic relationships, lead to emergent patterns such as stable equilibria and cyclic oscillations.

#### Mathematical Modeling

Various mathematical approaches are used to describe the emergent properties in recurrent systems, such as:

1. Nonlinear Dynamics: The application of nonlinear dynamics methods, including chaos theory, allows for the analysis of the complex behavior of recurrent systems.
2. Game Theory: Modeling the interactions between agents within the framework of game theory helps to understand how local rules can lead to global patterns.
3. Agent-Based Modeling: Computer simulations of systems consisting of many interacting agents provide a way to study emergent properties in complex environments.
4. Network Analysis: Representing complex systems as networks with recurrent connections allows for the application of graph theory methods to investigate their structural and dynamic characteristics.

#### Applications in Physics and Cosmology

Complex systems theory and the concept of emergence are finding increasingly widespread applications in physics and cosmology. For example:

1. Quantum Gravity: The idea that space-time may be an emergent property arising from more fundamental informational or quantum processes is an actively researched area in string theory and loop quantum gravity.
2. Cosmology: Recurrent processes and emergent properties may play a key role in the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe, as well as in the explanation of phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.
3. Condensed Matter Physics: The emergent properties of collective interactions in complex quantum systems, such as superconductors and topological insulators, are the subject of active research.

#### Conclusion

Complex systems theory provides a powerful conceptual and mathematical framework for understanding how emergent properties can arise from recurrent processes. The application of these ideas in physics and cosmology opens new perspectives for explaining fundamental phenomena in the Universe.



### Modern Cosmological Models and the Problems of Dark Matter and Dark Energy

#### The Standard Cosmological Model (ŒõCDM)

The modern standard cosmological model, known as the ŒõCDM model, is widely accepted in the scientific community. It includes the following key components:

1. **Expanding Universe**: The model is based on the Big Bang theory, according to which the Universe originated from an extremely dense and hot state and has been continuously expanding since then.

2. **Dark Matter**: The model postulates the existence of so-called "dark matter" - an invisible form of matter that interacts with ordinary matter only through gravitational effects. Dark matter is necessary to explain the observed structure of the Universe, including the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

3. **Dark Energy**: According to the ŒõCDM model, about 70% of the energy of the Universe is attributed to "dark energy" - a hypothetical field that is uniformly distributed in space and has a negative pressure, leading to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

4. **Cosmological Constant**: Dark energy in the ŒõCDM model is often represented by the cosmological constant Œõ, introduced by Einstein in his equations of general relativity.

#### Problems with the Standard Model

Despite the successes of the ŒõCDM model in explaining many observed cosmological phenomena, it faces several serious problems:

1. **Nature of Dark Matter**: Despite numerous attempts to detect dark matter particles in experiments, their nature remains unknown. The lack of direct observations of dark matter raises questions about its existence.

2. **Nature of Dark Energy**: The origin of dark energy and its connection to the cosmological constant also remain a mystery. Theoretical estimates of the value of the cosmological constant differ from the observed value by dozens of orders of magnitude.

3. **Flatness Problem**: The ŒõCDM model predicts that the Universe should be flat, but observations indicate a slight deviation from flatness, requiring additional explanations.

4. **Horizon Problem**: The ŒõCDM model cannot explain why different regions of the Universe, which could not have been in causal contact, demonstrate a high degree of homogeneity.

5. **Monopole Problem**: According to the Big Bang theory, magnetic monopoles should have been formed in the Universe, but they have not been observed.

#### Alternative Cosmological Models

To address these problems, scientists have proposed various alternative cosmological models, such as:

1. **Models with Modified Gravity**: These models assume that gravity behaves differently than in general relativity, which can explain the observed effects without the need for dark matter and dark energy.

2. **Models with Dynamic Dark Energy**: Instead of a constant cosmological constant, these models consider a dynamic field, whose properties can change over time and explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

3. **Cyclic Universe Models**: According to these models, the Universe can go through cycles of expansion and contraction, avoiding the Big Bang singularity.

4. **Models with Multidimensional Spacetime**: These models, based on string theory and loop quantum gravity, postulate the existence of additional spatial dimensions that can influence cosmological dynamics.

Despite active research in these directions, none of the alternative models can currently fully resolve all the problems of the standard ŒõCDM cosmological model. The search for new theoretical approaches and experimental verifications remains an important task in modern cosmology.



#### Solutions for Several Key Problems of the Standard ŒõCDM Cosmological Model

New cosmological models and the theory of the Recurrent Universe offer solutions for several key problems of the standard ŒõCDM cosmological model:

1. The Dark Matter Problem:
   - In the standard ŒõCDM model, dark matter is introduced as a hypothetical component, the nature of which remains unknown.
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe explains the effects attributed to dark matter as a consequence of integrated quantum information and recurrent processes in spacetime. There is no need for additional hypothetical particles.

2. The Dark Energy Problem:
   - The standard ŒõCDM model introduces the cosmological constant or dark energy to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe.
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe proposes an effective equation of state for dark energy, dependent on the parameters of integrated information and recurrence. This allows for the explanation of accelerated expansion without the introduction of a cosmological constant.

3. The Singularity Problem:
   - The standard ŒõCDM model predicts the emergence of a singularity at the beginning of the Universe (the Big Bang).
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe proposes mechanisms based on recurrent processes and integrated quantum information that can prevent the emergence of a singularity. Instead, a scenario of the emergent origin of spacetime is proposed.

4. The Initial Conditions Problem:
   - The standard ŒõCDM model requires specific initial conditions that must be set from the outside.
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe proposes mechanisms in which spacetime and its properties can emerge emergently from more fundamental information processes. This allows for the avoidance of the need for special initial conditions.

5. The Large-Scale Structure Problem:
   - The standard ŒõCDM model has difficulties in explaining the observed large-scale structure of the Universe.
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe connects the formation of structures to integrated quantum information and recurrent processes, which can lead to a more natural explanation of the observed features.

Thus, the theory of the Recurrent Universe offers alternative mechanisms based on information processes that can solve a number of fundamental problems of the standard ŒõCDM cosmological model.




### Quantum Gravity Theories

#### String Theory

String theory is one of the most promising theories of quantum gravity, which considers fundamental particles not as point-like objects, but as one-dimensional strings oscillating in a multi-dimensional spacetime. The main principles of string theory are:

1. **Multidimensionality of Spacetime**: According to string theory, the universe consists not of 4 dimensions (3 spatial + 1 temporal), but of 10 or 11 dimensions, most of which are "curled up" to microscopic sizes.

2. **Strings as Fundamental Objects**: Instead of point-like particles, in string theory the fundamental objects are one-dimensional strings, which can have open or closed forms and undergo various oscillations.

3. **Unification of Interactions**: String theory suggests that all four fundamental interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak) can be described within a single theoretical framework.

4. **Supersymmetry**: Many versions of string theory are based on the concept of supersymmetry, which predicts the existence of "superpartners" for each known elementary particle.

5. **Gauge/Gravity Duality**: There is a deep connection between gauge theories and the theory of gravity, which manifests in the so-called gauge/gravity duality.

Despite significant progress, string theory is still in the stage of active research and the search for experimental confirmation. The main challenges facing the theory include the choice of the correct version, the search for a mechanism to stabilize the additional dimensions, and the establishment of a connection with the observed universe.

#### Loop Quantum Gravity

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is an alternative approach to quantum gravity, which considers spacetime not as a smooth continuum, but as a discrete, "quantized" structure. The key ideas of LQG are:

1. **Discreteness of Spacetime**: According to LQG, spacetime has a discrete, "granular" structure at the Planck scale, rather than being continuous.

2. **Loop Entanglements**: The fundamental objects in LQG are loop entanglements, which can be viewed as "knots" in the "fabric" of spacetime.

3. **Quantization of Geometry**: Geometric quantities, such as volume and area, in LQG are quantized and take on discrete values.

4. **Absence of Singularities**: The discrete structure of spacetime in LQG allows for the avoidance of singularities, such as the Big Bang, within the theory.

5. **Connection to General Relativity**: Despite its discrete nature, LQG must reproduce Einstein's general theory of relativity in the macroscopic limit.

The main advantages of LQG are the ability to describe the quantum nature of gravity without the need for additional dimensions, as well as the potential to resolve the problem of singularities in general relativity. However, LQG also faces a number of challenges, such as the choice of the correct version of the theory and the establishment of a connection with observable phenomena.

Both string theory and loop quantum gravity represent actively developing research areas that aim to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single, consistent theory of quantum gravity. Despite the differences in their approaches, both theories make important contributions to our understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe.



#### Connections and Interactions with String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity

The theory of the Recurrent Universe and its concept of integrated quantum information may have important connections and interactions with string theory and loop quantum gravity:

1. Connection with the Holographic Principle:
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe is consistent with the holographic principle, which is a key element of string theory.
   - The idea that information plays a fundamental role in the structure of space-time unites these approaches.

2. Role of Quantum Information:
   - Loop quantum gravity emphasizes the quantum nature of gravity and the informational aspects.
   - The concept of integrated quantum information in the theory of the Recurrent Universe may contribute to a deeper understanding of quantum effects in gravity.

3. Geometry of Space-Time:
   - String theory and loop quantum gravity propose different approaches to the quantization of the geometry of space-time.
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe may offer a new perspective on these processes, linking them to informational parameters such as œÅ_(IQI) and R.

4. Possibility of Unification:
   - There is potential for unifying the theory of the Recurrent Universe with string theory and loop quantum gravity into a more general information-geometric theory.
   - Common conceptual foundations, such as the holographic principle and the role of information, may contribute to this synthesis.

5. Experimental Predictions:
   - The theory of the Recurrent Universe may offer new experimental signatures that can be tested in the context of string theory and loop quantum gravity.
   - Joint data analysis and the search for consistent predictions may help in the further development of these theories.

Overall, the theory of the Recurrent Universe offers a new information-oriented approach that may contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of space-time and its quantum structure. Integration with string theory and loop quantum gravity may lead to a fruitful synthesis, opening new perspectives in the field of quantum gravity.



### Mathematical Formulations and Equations of the Recurrent Universe Theory

#### Density of Integrated Quantum Information (œÅ_(IQI))

The density of integrated quantum information (œÅ_(IQI)) characterizes the amount of quantum information integrated within a unit volume of spacetime. It is defined as:

`œÅ_(IQI) = lim(Œî V ‚Üí 0) Œî I / Œî V`

where Œî I is the change in integrated information within the volume Œî V.

#### Recurrence Parameter (R)

The recurrence parameter (R) reflects the degree of recurrent interactions of quantum states in the spacetime continuum. It can be related to the probability of repeated quantum interactions or to the topological characteristics of recurrent structures.

#### Emergent Integrated Information Œ¶‚Çë

Within the framework of the Recurrent Universe theory, emergent integrated information Œ¶‚Çë represents an important physical quantity that reflects the informational aspects of spacetime structure.

Œ¶‚Çë can be considered as a measure of information that "emergently" arises from fundamental quantum processes and recurrent interactions in spacetime. It reflects the degree of integration and organization of quantum information that manifests in the macroscopic properties of the Universe.

Mathematically, emergent integrated information Œ¶‚Çë can be expressed through the integral over spacetime volume:

`Œ¶‚Çë = ‚à´ œÅ_(IQI) dV`

Where œÅ_(IQI) is the density of integrated quantum information introduced in the Recurrent Universe theory. This parameter characterizes the quantity and quality of quantum information unified in the spacetime continuum.

#### Effective Equation of State for Dark Energy

The introduction of the parameters œÅ_(IQI) and R allows for the determination of an effective equation of state for dark energy:

`w_(eff) = w‚ÇÄ + w‚ÇÅ f(œÅ_(IQI), R)`

where w‚ÇÄ and w‚ÇÅ are constants, and f is a function describing the influence of integrated information and recurrence on cosmological dynamics.

#### Modified Einstein Equations

The new parameters can be incorporated into the modified Einstein equations:

`G_(ŒºŒΩ) + Œõ g_(ŒºŒΩ) = 8œÄ G (( T_(ŒºŒΩ) + T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI) ))`

where G_(ŒºŒΩ) is the Einstein tensor, Œõ is the cosmological constant, T_(ŒºŒΩ) is the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter, and T_(ŒºŒΩ)^(IQI) is the energy-momentum tensor associated with integrated quantum information and recurrent effects.

#### Integration and Recurrence Operators

The state of the Universe in spacetime is described using the operators of information integration (^I) and recurrent mapping (^R):

`Œ® = ^I ^R ùìò`

where Œ® is the state of the Universe, and ùìò is its initial informational state.

#### Inclusion in Quantum Field Theory

The scalar field Œ¶_q(x) can be included in the Lagrangian density of the quantum field theory governing spacetime:

`ùìõ = ùìõ_(GR) + ùìõ_Œ¶`

where ùìõ_(GR) is the standard Lagrangian density of general relativity, and ùìõ_Œ¶ are additional terms associated with the field Œ¶_q(x).

#### Modified Expression for Entropy

Considering the concept of emergent information, a modified expression for entropy can be proposed:

`S_(eff) = k_B ln W - Œª Œ¶‚Çë`

where k_B is the Boltzmann constant, W is the number of microstates of the system, and Œª is a coefficient characterizing the contribution of emergent information Œ¶‚Çë to the entropy.

#### Modified Commutation Relation

It is proposed to modify the standard commutation relation as follows:

`[^x, ^p] = i‚Ñè (1 + f(Œ¶‚Çë))`

where f(Œ¶‚Çë) is a function describing the influence of emergent integrated information Œ¶‚Çë on the commutation of operators.

These mathematical formulations and equations form the foundation of the Recurrent Universe theory and the new cosmological model, allowing for the description of the influence of integrated quantum information and recurrent processes on the structure and dynamics of spacetime.



### Experimental Data and Observations

**Anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background**

The theory of the Recurrent Universe predicts certain features in the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the relic radiation left over from the early Universe. According to the model, the integrated quantum information and recurrent processes should leave specific signatures in the spatial distribution of the CMB temperature. Analysis of the data obtained from space missions such as WMAP and Planck can reveal deviations from the standard ŒõCDM model and confirm or refute the predictions of the theory of the Recurrent Universe.

**Distribution of Large-Scale Structure**

The new cosmological model also predicts features in the distribution of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and other large-scale structures of the Universe. These structures are formed under the influence of gravitational interactions, which, according to the theory, should be modified by the contribution of integrated quantum information and recurrence. Comparison of the observed data obtained from galaxy surveys such as SDSS and 2dFGRS with the model's predictions can become an important test of its viability.

**Gravitational Lensing Effects**

The theory of the Recurrent Universe predicts changes in the nature of gravitational lensing when light passes through regions with a high density of integrated quantum information. These effects can be detected by observing distant galaxies and quasars, whose light is bent by massive objects along the line of sight. Comparison of the observed patterns of gravitational lensing with theoretical predictions can become another way to test the model.

**Deviations from General Relativity**

Since the theory of the Recurrent Universe suggests a modification of the Einstein equations, there is a possibility of detecting deviations from general relativity on various scales. These can be, for example, measurements of gravitational waves, testing the laws of gravity in the Solar System, or observations of the motion of galaxies and clusters. The detection of such deviations could become a direct experimental confirmation of the proposed model.

**Cosmological Observations**

An important test for the theory of the Recurrent Universe will be its ability to explain and predict various cosmological observations, such as:

- The rate of expansion of the Universe at different epochs
- The ratio between dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter
- The evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe
- The age and geometry of the Universe

Comparison of the model's predictions with data obtained from space telescopes, ground-based observatories, and other cosmological experiments will allow assessing its viability and advantages over the standard ŒõCDM model.

The theory of the Recurrent Universe has close connections with areas such as quantum informatics, the theory of complex systems, and neurobiology. Further development of the model and its experimental verification may require an interdisciplinary approach, combining the efforts of physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and specialists in related fields. Such collaboration can lead to new breakthrough ideas and methods capable of revealing the fundamental nature of reality.

#### Opportunities for Unification of Theoretical Approaches

- There is potential for integrating the theory of the Recurrent Universe with string theory, loop quantum gravity, and other approaches within a more general information-geometric theory.
- The integration of concepts such as integrated quantum information, recurrence, and the emergent nature of space-time can contribute to the creation of a unified, consistent theory that explains the fundamental nature of reality.
- An interdisciplinary synthesis of ideas from various fields of physics, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy can open new perspectives for understanding the Universe and consciousness.

Thus, the theory of the Recurrent Universe and the new cosmological model have wide interdisciplinary connections and significant potential for integration with other theoretical approaches. This synthesis can lead to groundbreaking discoveries in our understanding of the fundamental structure of reality.
