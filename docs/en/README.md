### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Relevance of Studying Consciousness

Consciousness is one of the most mysterious and complex phenomena that attract the attention of scientists from various fields of knowledge — neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in studying the brain and cognitive processes, the nature of consciousness and the mechanisms of its emergence remain insufficiently understood.

#### 1.2. Existing Approaches and the Need for an Integrative Theory

Existing models, such as the Global Workspace Theory (GWT), the Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and the Predictive Coding Theory, offer valuable explanations for individual aspects of consciousness but often view this phenomenon from a single perspective, overlooking the complexity of interactions in the brain.

**Global Workspace Theory (GWT)** emphasizes the importance of information integration for the emergence of conscious experience, suggesting that information becomes conscious when it is accessible to the global workspace. However, GWT does not fully explain how this information integration occurs and what role recurrent connections play.

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** asserts that consciousness is related to a quantitative measure of integrated information in a system, denoted as Phi (Φ). This approach focuses on the structure and complexity of informational connections in neural networks but does not consider dynamic aspects such as recurrence.

**Predictive Coding Theory** views the brain as a hierarchical system that constantly predicts sensory inputs and updates its models based on prediction errors. This approach emphasizes the role of learning and adaptation in perception but does not cover all aspects of subjective conscious experience.

Therefore, there is a need for an integrative theory that combines key elements of these approaches, creating a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of consciousness. Such a theory should consider both the processes of information integration and the role of recurrent connections and predictive coding in forming conscious experience.

### 2. Main Provisions of EIRM Theory

#### 2.1. Emergence of Consciousness

![Emergence of Consciousness](/1.jpg "Illustration of the concept of emergent consciousness: abstraction")

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), consciousness is an emergent property arising from complex interactions in the brain's neural networks.

**Definition of Emergence**:

Emergence is the appearance of new properties or qualities in a complex system that cannot be predicted or explained solely based on the properties of individual components.

**Consciousness as an Emergent Property**:

- Consciousness is not the result of the activity of individual neurons or even specific brain regions.
- It arises from the complex dynamics of interactions between various neural networks and systems.
- The collective activity of neurons, their synchronization, and coordination lead to the emergence of subjective experience.

**Examples of Emergence in Neural Networks**:

- Synchronization of neural oscillations: Collective waves of activity, such as gamma rhythms, are not inherent to individual neurons but arise from their interactions.
- Processing of images and concepts: High-level representations, such as concepts or abstract ideas, emerge from the interactions of multiple neural circuits.

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, consciousness is an emergent property arising from complex recurrent interactions and information integration in the brain's neural networks.


#### 2.2. Information Integration

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), information integration is a key mechanism underlying the formation of conscious experience.

##### 2.2.1 The Necessity of Integration

- To create a holistic perception of the world, the brain must integrate information from various sensory channels and cognitive processes.
- Integration allows disparate information to be combined, creating a complex and coherent experience.

##### 2.2.2 Mechanisms of Integration

**Functional Connections between Brain Regions**:

Neural pathways connecting different regions, such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, provide information integration.

**Global Workspace**:

According to the concept of the global workspace, consciousness arises when information becomes accessible to multiple cognitive processes through a widespread network. Integrated information is broadcast across this network, allowing various cognitive systems to use it simultaneously.

**Integrated Information Metric (Φ)**:

Detailed description:

- [Emergent Integrated Information](/Integrated-Information-Metric.md)
- [Components of the Φₑ Metric](/Components-of-the-F-metric.md)

Φ is a measure of the degree of integrated information in a system. Φₑ is a metric of emergent integrated information that considers both the quantity and quality of integrated information in the context of recurrent processing:

`Φₑ = ∫₀^(t₁) I(integration)(t) ⋅ R(recurrence)(t) dt`

Where:

- I(integration)(t) - the degree of information integration at time t.
- R(recurrence)(t) - the degree of recurrent processing at time t.

Thus, information integration, provided by functional connections, the global workspace, and the Φₑ metric, is a key mechanism underlying the formation of conscious experience according to the EIRM theory.


#### 2.3. The Role of Recurrent Connections in Forming Conscious Experience

Recurrent connections in the brain play a key role in the processes underlying consciousness according to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM). Consciousness arises from the emergent integration of information mediated by recurrent neural interactions.

##### 2.3.1. Recurrent Circuits in the Brain

Research shows that during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phase, when the most intense dream activity occurs, specific recurrent circuits are activated in the brain:

- **Thalamo-cortical loops**: The interaction between the thalamus and various cortical areas forms closed recurrent cycles of information processing. These loops play a key role in generating oscillatory patterns characteristic of REM sleep.

- **Cortico-cortical connections**: Feedback projections between associative cortical areas (e.g., prefrontal, parietal, temporal) provide recurrent integration of information underlying complex dream plots.

- **Hippocampal-neocortical interactions**: Recurrent connections between the hippocampus and neocortex allow the integration of episodic memories and semantic knowledge into coherent dream narratives.

##### 2.3.2. Mechanisms of Recurrent Activation in Consciousness

Recurrent connections in the brain provide the following key mechanisms underlying the formation of conscious experience:

1. **Reactivation of memory traces**: Recurrent interactions between the hippocampus and neocortex lead to the reactivation of neural ensembles encoding memories. This allows "replaying" episodic events in consciousness.

2. **Generation of internal predictions**: Recurrent circuits in associative cortical areas form predictions about possible events and sensory experiences, which are then "projected" into conscious experience.

3. **Integration of disparate information**: Closed recurrent cycles between different brain areas facilitate the integration of fragmented elements of memory, perception, and imagination into coherent representations of consciousness.

4. **Maintenance of neural ensemble activity**: Recurrent connections provide prolonged maintenance of excitation in neural populations, allowing conscious experience to maintain stability and continuity over time.

##### 2.3.3. Disruptions in Recurrence and Their Impact on Consciousness

Research shows that pathological changes in the brain's recurrent connections significantly affect the characteristics of conscious experience:

- **Reduced recurrence**: Disruptions in thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical interactions (e.g., in dementias) lead to fragmented, incoherent conscious experiences.

- **Excessive recurrence**: Hyperactivity of recurrent circuits (as in schizophrenia) can lead to hyper-integrated, bizarre conscious states with delusional elements.

- **Desynchronization**: Desynchronization of recurrent interactions (as in narcolepsy) can cause intermittent, chaotic conscious experiences.

Thus, recurrent connections in the brain play a key role in generating, structuring, and maintaining conscious experience. Disruptions in these mechanisms underlie many consciousness disorders.

#### 2.4. Mechanisms of Predictive Coding

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), predictive coding is an important mechanism underlying the formation of conscious experience.

More details: [Predictive Coding](/predictive-coding.md)

##### 2.4.1. Basic Principles of Predictive Coding

1. **Brain Predictiveness**: The brain is viewed as a predictive machine that constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs based on internal models and updates these models according to prediction errors.

2. **Prediction Error**: The difference between expected (predicted) sensory signals and actual sensory data is called prediction error. This error serves as a signal for updating internal models.

3. **Model Updating**: Prediction errors are used to adjust and improve internal models of the world, allowing the brain to more accurately predict future sensory events.

##### 2.4.2. Hierarchical Structure of the Brain

1. **Multilevel Organization**: The brain is organized hierarchically, with multiple levels of information processing from lower (sensory) to higher (abstract).

2. **Top-Down and Bottom-Up Information Flows**:
   - **Top-Down Flows**: Higher levels send predictions to lower levels.
   - **Bottom-Up Flows**: Lower levels transmit prediction errors up the hierarchy.

3. **Recurrence**: Continuous information exchange between levels allows the brain to quickly and efficiently update predictions.

##### 2.4.3. Free Energy Principle

1. **Free Energy**: Introduced by Karl Friston, the free energy principle links Bayesian updating with the thermodynamic concept of free energy.

2. **Minimization of Free Energy**: The brain aims to minimize free energy, which is equivalent to minimizing prediction error and updating internal models.

3. **Relation to Entropy**: Minimizing free energy also leads to a reduction in entropy, i.e., uncertainty in the system.

##### 2.4.4. Neural Implementations

1. **Predictive Neurons**: Neurons responsible for generating predictions based on internal models.

2. **Prediction Error Neurons**: Neurons that detect and transmit information about prediction errors.

3. **Synaptic Plasticity**: Changes in synaptic weights are the mechanism for updating internal models based on prediction errors.

4. **Communication Between Levels**:
   - **Ascending Connections**: Transmit prediction errors up the hierarchy.
   - **Descending Connections**: Transmit predictions down the hierarchy.

Thus, predictive coding plays a key role in forming conscious experience according to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM). The brain constantly generates predictions, updates internal models, and uses prediction errors for adaptation and learning, which is an important mechanism underlying consciousness.

#### 2.5. The Role of Attention and Working Memory in Information Integration Processes

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), attention and working memory play a key role in the information integration processes underlying conscious experience.

##### 2.5.1. Attention

**Selection Mechanisms**: Attention allows the selection of relevant information from the stream of sensory data for deeper processing. This ensures the selection and focus on important aspects of perceived information.

**Modulation of Activity**: Attention enhances signals in relevant neural networks, increasing their contribution to conscious perception. This is achieved through mechanisms involving the activation of structures such as the pulvinar of the thalamus and frontal areas.

**Role of Neuromodulators**: Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine regulate the level of attention and enhance the synchronization of neural networks, facilitating information integration [4, 5].

##### 2.5.2. Working Memory

**Short-Term Information Retention**: Working memory allows information to be kept in an active state for further processing and decision-making.

**Interaction with Recurrent Networks**: Recurrent connections between different brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, support the maintenance of activity necessary for the functioning of working memory [6, 7].

**Role in Information Integration**: The interaction of attention and working memory ensures the retention and manipulation of relevant information, which is key to the integration processes underlying conscious experience.

Thus, the mechanisms of attention and working memory play a critical role in modulating and coordinating the information integration processes described by the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM). They contribute to the selection, maintenance, and integration of information necessary for forming a coherent conscious perception.

### 3. Neurobiological Foundations of the Theory

![Neurobiological Foundations of the Theory](/4.jpg "Diagram of Information Integration and Recurrent Processing")


#### 3.1. Integrative Neural Networks

##### 3.1.1. Canonical Cortical Microcircuits

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), the cerebral cortex contains repeating structures of neural circuits that play a key role in information integration.

**Pyramidal Neurons**

The main excitatory cells of the cortex are pyramidal neurons, which have extensive dendritic trees. This allows them to integrate numerous synaptic inputs, facilitating the integration of diverse information [10].

**Canonical Microcircuits**

The cerebral cortex contains repeating structures known as "canonical microcircuits." These microcircuits consist of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons that provide local integration of information coming from various sources [11].

**Role of Horizontal Connections**

Horizontal connections between neurons within a single layer of the cortex play an important role in information integration. These dense networks, connected by excitatory and inhibitory synapses, facilitate the temporal synchronization of neuronal activity, which underlies the combination of sensory features into coherent perceptual images [12].

**Vertical Integration**

In addition to horizontal connections, vertical interactions between cortical layers also provide hierarchical information integration. Neurons in vertical microcolumns exhibit a high degree of interconnectedness, allowing signals to be integrated from lower sensory areas to higher associative regions [13].

Thus, canonical cortical microcircuits, including pyramidal neurons, horizontal and vertical connections, are key structures that provide information integration according to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

##### 3.1.2. Long-Term and Short-Term Connections

The EIRM theory emphasizes the importance of both long-term and short-term connections in information integration processes.

**Long-Term Associative Connections**

Long-term associative connections link distant brain areas, such as the connection between the visual and auditory cortices. These connections provide the integration of information from different modalities, contributing to the formation of coherent multisensory representations [14].

**Short-Term Local Connections**

Short-term local connections between neurons within a single cortical area allow for efficient information exchange and signal integration within individual functional modules. This facilitates the combination of elementary features into more complex perceptual patterns [15].

**Functional Connectivity**

Neuroimaging studies show that conscious states are associated with increased functional connectivity between different brain areas. This reflects the effective integration of information necessary for the formation of a coherent conscious experience [16].

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, both long-term associative connections and short-term local connections play an important role in the information integration processes underlying consciousness.


#### 3.2. Recurrent Connections and Loops

##### 3.2.1. Thalamo-Cortical Loops

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), thalamo-cortical loops play a key role in generating and maintaining conscious experience.

**Role of the Thalamus**

The thalamus is the central relay station for sensory information to the cerebral cortex. It receives input signals from various sensory systems and transmits them to the corresponding primary sensory areas of the cortex [3].

**Thalamo-Cortical Interactions**

The thalamus and cerebral cortex form closed recurrent loops in which information circulates between these structures. Feedback projections from the cortex to the thalamus play an important role in these recurrent interactions [17].

**Generation of Oscillatory Patterns**

Research shows that thalamo-cortical loops are a key source of generating oscillatory patterns characteristic of various sleep phases, including rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [18]. These rhythmic oscillations underlie the synchronization of neuronal activity necessary for information integration.

**Role in Conscious Perception**

The interaction of the thalamus and cortex within recurrent loops provides cyclic processing of sensory information, which plays a key role in forming conscious perception. Disruptions in thalamo-cortical connections can lead to consciousness disorders [19].

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, thalamo-cortical loops are an important neurobiological mechanism providing the recurrent dynamics necessary for information integration and the emergence of conscious experience.

##### 3.2.2. Cortico-Cortical Feedback Connections

In addition to thalamo-cortical loops, the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) emphasizes the importance of cortico-cortical feedback connections in the processes underlying consciousness.

**Feedback Projections Between Cortical Areas**

Feedback connections from higher associative cortical areas to lower sensory regions play a key role in recurrent information processing [3]. These descending projections allow higher levels to modulate the activity of lower areas.

**Role in Predictive Coding**

According to the EIRM theory, cortico-cortical feedback connections are an important component of predictive coding mechanisms. Higher areas generate predictions that are then transmitted down the hierarchy, where they are compared with incoming sensory signals [6, 7].

**Integration of Sensory and Contextual Information**

Feedback projections from associative areas to sensory regions allow the integration of current sensory data with contextual information stored at higher levels. This contributes to the formation of coherent perceptual representations [20].

**Role in Conscious Perception**

Research shows that disruptions in cortico-cortical feedback connections lead to deficits in conscious perception. Weakening these recurrent interactions hinders the effective integration of information underlying conscious experience [3, 4].

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, cortico-cortical feedback connections are a key mechanism providing recurrent dynamics and information integration at various levels of the cortical hierarchy, playing a critical role in forming conscious experience.


#### 3.3. Predictive Coding

![Predictive Coding](/2.jpg "Visualization of Predictive Coding")


##### 3.3.1. Hierarchical Organization

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), predictive coding plays a key role in forming conscious experience. The brain is organized as a hierarchical system where higher levels generate predictions that are then transmitted to lower levels.

Higher cortical areas, such as the prefrontal and associative zones, generate predictions about possible sensory inputs based on internal models accumulated from previous experience. These predictions are transmitted via descending connections to lower sensory areas.

In turn, primary sensory regions, such as the visual cortex (V1), compare incoming sensory signals with predictions received from above. The difference between the predicted and actual signal, called prediction error, is transmitted via ascending connections back to higher levels.

Thus, the brain constantly generates predictions, compares them with current sensory data, and uses prediction errors to update internal models. This hierarchical organization, with descending predictions and ascending errors, underlies the predictive coding mechanisms described by the EIRM theory.

##### 3.3.2. Prediction Errors

According to the EIRM theory, prediction errors play a key role in forming conscious experience. The difference between expected (predicted) sensory signals and actual input data is defined as prediction error.

These prediction errors are transmitted via ascending connections from lower sensory areas to higher associative regions. Higher levels, receiving information about errors, initiate processes to update internal models to minimize these errors in the future.

Thus, prediction errors serve as signals for adjusting and adapting the brain's internal representations. This model updating mechanism based on prediction errors underlies the brain's ability to learn and adapt, playing an important role in forming conscious experience.

For example, if sensory inputs do not match predictions, the resulting prediction errors initiate processes aimed at updating internal models. This allows the brain to constantly adapt its representations of the world, ensuring more accurate and adaptive perception.

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, prediction errors are a key mechanism underlying predictive coding and play an important role in forming conscious experience.

#### 3.4. The Role of Neurotransmitter Systems in Recurrent Processes and Information Integration

Neurotransmitter systems in the brain play a key role in modulating various processes described by the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), including recurrent interactions and information integration.

##### 3.4.1. The Role of Monoaminergic Systems

Monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA), have a significant impact on emotional states and their interaction with cognitive processes.

1. **Serotonin (5-HT)**: Reduced activity of the serotonergic system is associated with the development of depressive states and anxiety. Decreased levels of 5-HT weaken recurrent interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system, leading to impaired integration of emotional information [21, 22].

2. **Norepinephrine (NE)**: The noradrenergic system is involved in stress responses and the activation of arousal systems. Increased levels of NE enhance recurrent connections between areas involved in processing emotional information, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex [23, 24]. This contributes to more effective integration of emotional aspects into conscious experience.

3. **Dopamine (DA)**: The dopaminergic system is associated with the experience of reward and pleasure. Increased activity of DA neurons modulates recurrent interactions in the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems, affecting the emotional coloring of conscious experience [25, 26].

##### 3.4.2. The Role of the Cholinergic System

The cholinergic system, which uses acetylcholine (ACh) as a neurotransmitter, also plays an important role in regulating emotional processes and their integration with cognitive functions.

1. **Acetylcholine (ACh)**: Increased activity of the cholinergic system is associated with enhanced recurrent interactions between the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus [27, 28]. This contributes to more effective integration of emotional information into the formation of conscious experience.

2. **Modulation of Attention and Memory**: Acetylcholine plays a key role in regulating attention processes and the consolidation of emotional memory. This indirectly affects the parameters of information integration and recurrence, determining emergent integrated information Φₑ [29, 30].

Thus, imbalances in various neurotransmitter systems, such as serotonin deficiency in depression or excess norepinephrine in anxiety disorders, lead to disruptions in recurrent activity and the integration of emotional information. This, in turn, affects the parameters of EIRM, including a decrease in emergent integrated information Φₑ and an imbalance in the degree of recurrence R(t) and emotional modulation E(t) [31, 32].


#### 3.5. Structural and Functional Connectivity Between Brain Areas

In addition to local neural mechanisms, structural and functional connectivity between different brain areas plays an important role in information integration and the formation of a coherent conscious experience.

##### 3.5.1. Analysis of Connectivity Between Brain Areas

Studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow mapping of structural and functional connections between different cortical regions and subcortical structures [33, 34]. These methods enable the assessment of:

- The density and topology of anatomical connections reflecting structural connectivity.
- The temporal correlation of activity between distant areas characterizing functional connectivity.

Analysis of the brain connectome allows identifying key areas involved in information integration and exploring the features of their interactions.

##### 3.5.2. The Role of Long Associative Pathways in Integration

Long associative pathways connecting primary sensory, secondary associative, and prefrontal cortical areas play a special role in information integration processes [35, 36]. These anatomical tracts provide:

- Convergence of signals from different modalities.
- Recurrent interactions between hierarchical levels of information processing.
- Propagation of activation and synchronization of neural ensembles underlying coherent perception.

Disruptions in structural and functional connectivity associated with damage to associative pathways can lead to deficits in information integration and fragmentation of conscious experience observed in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

### 4. Mathematical Modeling

![Mathematical Formalization](/3.jpg "Graphical representation of the Emergent Integrated Information Metric Φₑ")



#### 4.1. Recurrent Dynamic Systems

More details: [Recurrent Dynamic Systems](/Recurrent-dynamic-systems.md)

##### 4.1.1. Models Based on Differential Equations

According to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), the dynamics of neural networks underlying consciousness can be described using models based on differential equations.

**State Equations of Neural Networks**

The key equation describing the dynamics of recurrent neural networks is:

`dx/dt = f(x(t), u(t), W)`

Where:

- x(t) - the state vector of the network at time t
- u(t) - the input signal vector
- W - the weight matrix of connections, including recurrent connections
- f - a nonlinear function describing the system's dynamics

This equation reflects how the state of the neural network x(t) changes over time under the influence of input signals u(t) and depending on the structure of connections represented by the weight matrix W. The nonlinear function f describes the complex dynamics of neuron interactions, including recurrent processes.


**Modeling Recurrent Processes**

Recurrent connections in neural networks play a key role in forming conscious experience according to the EIRM theory. Mathematical modeling of these processes can be carried out using:

1. Feedback Models:
   - Neurons in the network receive not only input signals but also signals from their own outputs
   - This allows considering the influence of previous states on current activity

2. Delay Models:
   - Introducing time delays in signal transmission between neurons
   - Reflects the temporal dynamics of recurrent interactions

3. Distributed Parameter Models:
   - Considering the spatial distribution of neurons and their connections
   - Allows modeling the topology of recurrent circuits

Applying these approaches to modeling recurrent neural networks enables the investigation of how the dynamics of these interactions influence the formation of conscious experience within the EIRM theory.



##### 4.1.2. Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaotic Processes

The Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) suggests that consciousness may be associated with the nonlinear, chaotic dynamics of neural networks.

Models Based on Nonlinear Differential Equations

To model the complex, vortex-like behavior of neural networks, models based on nonlinear differential equations, such as the Lorenz and Rössler equations, can be used:

```
dx/dt = σ(y - x)
dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y
dz/dt = xy - βz
```

Where σ, ρ, β are parameters determining the nature of the system's nonlinear dynamics. Analysis of Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimension, and entropy of these models allows quantitatively assessing the degree of chaos, complexity, and variability of behavior, which is related to the emergent properties of consciousness [37, 38].

**Connection with Recurrent Processes**

According to the EIRM theory, recurrent interactions in neural networks underlie the emergence of complex, nonlinear dynamics that determine the emergent properties of consciousness. Closed feedback loops provide cyclic activation of neural ensembles, contributing to the formation of chaotic, vortex-like activity patterns [37, 38].

**Modeling Emergent Properties**

Applying models of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory allows investigating how recurrent processes lead to the emergence of properties such as self-organization, adaptability, and behavioral variability. This approach enables quantitatively assessing the degree of emergence associated with the formation of conscious experience within the EIRM theory.



#### 4.2. Bayesian Models of Predictive Coding

The Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) suggests that predictive coding is a key mechanism underlying the formation of conscious experience. Mathematical modeling of these processes can be carried out using Bayesian approaches.

##### 4.2.1. Probabilistic Prediction Models

According to the Bayesian approach, the brain can be represented as a probabilistic system that constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates its internal models based on prediction errors. This can be described as follows:

`P(θ | D) = P(D | θ) * P(θ) / P(D)`

Where:

- θ - parameters of the internal model
- D - observed data (sensory inputs)
- P(θ | D) - posterior distribution of parameters after considering the data
- P(D | θ) - likelihood of the data given the parameters
- P(θ) - prior distribution of parameters
- P(D) - marginal likelihood of the data

This Bayesian approach allows modeling how the brain updates its internal representations according to the principles of predictive coding, influencing the processes of information integration and recurrent processing reflected in the EIRM theory.

##### 4.2.2. Probabilistic Graphical Models

For more detailed modeling of predictive coding within the EIRM theory, probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks can be used. In these models, graph nodes correspond to different parameters, and edges reflect probabilistic dependencies between them [7, 39].

Applying probabilistic graphical models allows investigating how the brain forms hierarchical internal representations, generates predictions, and updates them based on errors, underlying the predictive coding mechanisms described by the EIRM theory.



#### 4.3. Integration of Mathematical Models with Experimental Data

The Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) suggests that a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying consciousness requires integrating mathematical models with experimental data obtained using various neurobiological methods.

**Combining Modeling and Experiments**

Combining mathematical models describing the dynamics of neural networks with data obtained using neuroimaging methods (fMRI, EEG, MEG), electrophysiology, and optogenetics allows achieving the following advantages:

1. High Spatiotemporal Accuracy:
   - Mathematical models provide a detailed description of neural process dynamics
   - Experimental data provide information about real brain activity

2. Possibility of Causal Analysis:
   - Mathematical models allow identifying key mechanisms underlying conscious processes
   - Experimental manipulations (e.g., optogenetics) enable testing causal hypotheses

3. Verification of Theoretical Predictions:
   - Mathematical models based on the EIRM theory generate predictions
   - Experimental data allow testing and refining these predictions

**Examples of Model and Experiment Integration**

   - Modeling the dynamics of recurrent interactions
   - Comparing with spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity

2. Integrating Bayesian models of predictive coding with EEG and optogenetics data:
   - Modeling processes of updating internal representations
   - Experimentally testing the influence of neural activity modulation

3. Combining nonlinear dynamics models with behavioral variability data:
   - Modeling emergent properties associated with chaotic dynamics
   - Comparing with experimental measures of complexity and adaptability
   





#### 4.4. Emergent Integrated Information (Φₑ)

Emergent Integrated Information (Φₑ) is a central metric in the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM). It is designed to quantitatively describe the level of consciousness in a system, considering both the quantity of integrated information and the quality of its processing in the context of recurrent connections.

**Metric Formula**

`Φₑ = ∫₍t₀₎^(t₁) [ I₍integration₎(t) × R₍recurrence₎(t) ] dt`

where:

- I₍integration₎(t) — the degree of information integration at time t.

- R₍recurrence₎(t) — the degree of recurrent processing at time t.

- The integral is calculated over the time interval from t₀ to t₁.


**Components of the Metric**

##### 4.4.1. Degree of Information Integration (I₍integration₎(t))

**Definition**:

I₍integration₎(t) measures how integrated and connected the information in the system is among its various parts at time t.

A high degree of integration means that different components of the system exchange information efficiently, creating a coherent representation.


**Calculation Methods**:

1. Entropy Approach:

   - Mutual information between different components of the system is used.

   - Formula:

   - `I₍integration₎(t) = ∑₍i,j₎ [ H(Xᵢ(t)) + H(Xⱼ(t)) - H(Xᵢ(t), Xⱼ(t)) ]`

   - where: H(Xᵢ(t)) — entropy of component i, H(Xᵢ(t), Xⱼ(t)) — joint entropy of components i and j.


2. Graph Methods:

   - Connections between neurons or groups of neurons are analyzed.

   - Metrics such as clustering, centrality, and information transfer efficiency are used.


##### 4.4.2. Degree of Recurrent Processing (R₍recurrence₎(t))

**Definition**:

- R₍recurrence₎(t) evaluates the quantity and quality of feedback connections in the system.

- Recurrent connections allow the system to consider past experiences when processing current information.


**Calculation Methods**:

1. Density of Recurrent Connections:

   - Formula:

   - `R₍recurrence₎(t) = (Number of recurrent connections at time t) / (Total possible recurrent connections)`


2. Strength of Recurrent Connections:

   - The weight or efficiency of each recurrent connection is considered.

   - Formula:

   - `R₍recurrence₎(t) = ∑₍i₎ ∑₍j₎ wᵢⱼ(t)`

   - where wᵢⱼ(t) — weight of the recurrent connection between neurons i and j at time t.

3. Spectral Analysis:

   - Study of the dynamic properties of the network.

   - Analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the recurrent connection matrix to assess the stability and dynamics of the system.

##### 4.4.3. Justification of the Φₑ Metric

- Integration over Time:

  - Allows considering the dynamics of integration and recurrence processes.

  - Reflects the cumulative effect of component interactions in the system.

- Product of `I₍integration₎(t) and R₍recurrence₎(t)`:

  - Indicates that a high level of consciousness is associated not only with information integration but also with active recurrent processing.

  - These two components mutually enhance each other's influence on the overall level of consciousness.

##### 4.4.4. Advantages of the Φₑ Metric

- Integrativity:

  - Combines different aspects of neural dynamics.

  - Provides a more complete picture of the processes leading to the emergence of consciousness.

- Dynamism:

  - Takes into account changes over time, which is important for understanding consciousness as a process rather than a static state.

- Quantitative Assessment:

  - Allows comparisons between different states of the system.

  - Can be used for experiments and modeling.

##### 4.4.5. Applications of the Metric in Research

- Comparing Levels of Consciousness:

  - Assessing Φₑ in different states (e.g., wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia).

  - Linking the metric with subjective reports of conscious experience.

- Modeling Pathologies:

  - Investigating disruptions in integration or recurrence in various disorders (schizophrenia, dementia).

  - Developing diagnostic criteria based on Φₑ.

- Developing Artificial Intelligence:

  - Using the metric to assess the "consciousness" of artificial systems.

  - Optimizing neural network architectures to increase Φₑ.

### 5. Experimental Data

#### 5.1. Neuroimaging Studies

##### 5.1.1. Functional MRI and PET Scanning

Neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide valuable data supporting the key tenets of the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

**Hierarchical Organization and Information Integration**

Studies using fMRI demonstrate the hierarchical organization of the perception system in the cerebral cortex [40]. When simple sensory stimuli are presented, primary sensory areas are activated, while more complex objects and events sequentially activate secondary and associative areas. These data are consistent with the EIRM theory's predictions about multilevel information integration.

**Recurrent Interactions and Conscious Perception**

Studies using PET scanning show that conscious states are associated with increased activity and functional connectivity in recurrent neural circuits [5]. Areas demonstrating increased recurrent activity include the fronto-parietal network and the default mode network, which aligns with the key role of recurrence in the EIRM theory.

**Disruptions in Integration in Consciousness Disorders**

fMRI and PET scanning data from patients with consciousness disorders, such as coma and vegetative state, show significant reductions in functional connectivity and information integration in the brain [41]. These results indicate that disruptions in emergent information integration mechanisms underlie consciousness disorders, consistent with the EIRM theory.

Thus, neuroimaging studies using fMRI and PET scanning provide experimental data supporting the key tenets of the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) regarding hierarchical organization, recurrent interactions, and disruptions in information integration in consciousness disorders.

##### 5.1.2. EEG and MEG

Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are other important neuroimaging methods providing data supporting the key tenets of the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

**Synchronization of Neuronal Activity**

Studies using EEG and MEG show that conscious perception is accompanied by increased synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma range (30-100 Hz) [42, 43]. This synchronization reflects the temporal coordination of distributed neuronal ensembles, which underlies the information integration processes described by the EIRM theory.

**Recurrent Interactions and Predictive Coding**

Analysis of EEG and MEG data also demonstrates that processes of memory retrieval are accompanied by increased activity in recurrent neural circuits [44, 45]. This is consistent with the key role of recurrent interactions and predictive coding in forming conscious experience according to the EIRM theory.

**Disruptions in Synchronization in Consciousness Disorders**

Studies using EEG and MEG show that patients with consciousness disorders, such as coma and vegetative state, exhibit reduced synchronization of neuronal activity in various frequency ranges [46, 47]. These data indicate that disruptions in the temporal integration mechanisms underlying the EIRM theory are a key factor in consciousness disorders.

Thus, electrophysiological methods such as EEG and MEG provide important experimental data supporting the role of neuronal activity synchronization, recurrent interactions, and predictive coding in forming conscious experience, as predicted by the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).


#### 5.2. Clinical Observations

##### 5.2.1. Patients with Consciousness Disorders

Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) show that patients with various consciousness disorders exhibit a significant reduction in emergent integrated information (Φₑ) compared to healthy subjects.

In the study by Casali et al. (2013) [46], a method for calculating Φₑ based on EEG data was developed. The authors found that Φₑ was significantly reduced in patients in a vegetative state compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001). Moreover, the degree of reduction in Φₑ correlated with clinical assessments of consciousness levels.

Similar results were obtained in the study by Sitt et al. (2014) [47], where fMRI data showed that Φₑ predicted the level of consciousness with high accuracy (AUC = 0.92). The authors concluded that disruptions in information integration in recurrent neural networks are a key mechanism of consciousness disorders.

These data indicate that disruptions in emergent information integration and recurrent processing mechanisms underlie cognitive deficits in various consciousness disorders, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.

##### 5.2.2. Effects of Anesthesia

According to the EIRM theory, a reduction in emergent integrated information (Φₑ) should be observed under the influence of anesthesia.

The study by Casali et al. (2013) [46] demonstrated that anesthesia significantly reduces Φₑ. The authors developed the Φ_complexity index to assess the level of consciousness, which showed a substantial decrease under the influence of anesthetics.

These results are consistent with the review by Hudetz (2012) [48], which discusses that anesthesia leads to disruptions in information integration and recurrent processes in the brain. The reduction in Φₑ under anesthesia reflects the weakening of mechanisms underlying conscious experience according to the EIRM theory.

Thus, clinical observations of patients with consciousness disorders and under anesthesia confirm the central tenets of the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) regarding the key role of information integration and recurrent processes in forming conscious experience.


#### 5.3. Experiments with Visual Masking

Experiments using visual masking confirm the key role of recurrent processes in forming conscious experience, as predicted by the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

Studies show that interrupting recurrent information processing prevents the conscious perception of stimuli, despite their initial registration in sensory areas of the brain.

In the work by Lamme & Roelfsema (2000) [3], it was demonstrated that visual masking, which disrupts recurrent interactions between lower and higher levels of the visual system, leads to stimuli being processed at early stages but not reaching conscious perception.

Similar results were obtained in the study by Dehaene et al. (2006) [16], where the authors proposed a taxonomy of different levels of conscious processing. They showed that interrupting recurrent processes prevents the awareness of stimuli, which can still be processed at an unconscious level.

These data indicate that the integrity of recurrent interactions between different brain areas is critically important for forming conscious experience. Disruptions in recurrent information processing may underlie perceptual deficits in various pathological conditions, consistent with the key tenets of the EIRM theory.

#### 5.4. Optogenetic Studies

Optogenetics is a powerful tool for studying causal relationships between various neural mechanisms underlying conscious processes according to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

Using optogenetic methods, researchers can selectively modulate the activity of specific neuronal populations affecting key components of the EIRM theory and study their influence on forming conscious experience.

For example, with optogenetic stimulation, it is possible to:

1. **Activate Neurons Related to Recurrent Processes**:
   - Modulate the activity of neurons in thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical recurrent circuits
   - Investigate the influence of increased recurrence on information integration and conscious perception

2. **Inhibit Neurons Involved in Predictive Coding**:
   - Suppress the activity of neurons encoding prediction errors
   - Assess the impact of disrupting predictive coding on information integration processes

3. **Modulate Neurons Related to Attention and Working Memory**:
   - Activate neurons in the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex involved in attention mechanisms
   - Investigate the influence of modulating attention and working memory on emergent information integration

Applying optogenetic methods allows establishing causal relationships between the activity of specific neuronal populations and the parameters described in the EIRM theory, such as the degree of recurrence, information integration, and forming conscious experience.

This approach enables directly testing theoretical model predictions based on EIRM principles and gaining a deeper understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying consciousness.

#### 5.5. Application of Machine Learning Methods

Machine learning methods play an important role in research aimed at verifying and developing the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

**Classification of Conscious States**

Machine learning allows developing algorithms for classifying different states of consciousness based on neuroimaging data. For example, in the work by Sitt et al. (2014) [47], a machine learning method was applied to predict the level of consciousness in patients based on fMRI measurements. The authors showed that the emergent integrated information parameter Φₑ could be used for accurate diagnosis of consciousness disorders.

**Modeling Recurrent Neural Networks**

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful tool for modeling the dynamics of neural systems underlying the EIRM theory. These models can account for temporal dependencies and recurrent interactions, which are important for understanding the mechanisms of information integration and forming conscious experience [37, 38].

**Training Predictive Models**

Machine learning methods, such as Bayesian networks and deep neural networks, can be applied to train predictive models reflecting the predictive coding mechanisms described in the EIRM theory. These approaches allow modeling how the brain updates its internal representations based on prediction errors [6, 7].

**Analysis of Complexity and Emergence**

Machine learning methods based on information theory and nonlinear dynamics can be used to quantitatively assess the complexity, variability, and emergent properties of neural systems. This allows investigating how these characteristics are related to forming conscious experience within the EIRM theory [37, 38].

Thus, applying machine learning methods plays an important role in verifying theoretical predictions, building mathematical models, and quantitatively analyzing the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness according to the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM).

### 6. Clinical Aspects

#### 6.1. Features of Conscious Experience in Mental Disorders

According to the extended Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), imbalances in emotional and cognitive processes observed in various mental disorders can significantly affect the parameters characterizing conscious experience.

For example, in depression, there may be a decrease in the emotional modulation parameter E(t), reflecting the predominance of negative emotions. Anxiety disorders, in turn, may be characterized by increased arousal A(t) and changes in emotional specificity S(t), associated with intense experiences of fear and anxiety [21, 32].

According to the extended EIRM theory, mental disorders may be associated with an imbalance between various components included in the formula for emergent integrated information Φₑ:

`Φₑ = ∫₀^(t₁) I(t) ⋅ R(t) ⋅ E(t) ⋅ C(t) ⋅ S(t) ⋅ A(t) ⋅ M(t) ⋅ P(t) ⋅ V(t) ⋅ T(t) ⋅ K(t) dt`

For example, in schizophrenia, there may be disruptions in the parameters of cognitive complexity C(t) and social context S(t), leading to distortions in information integration I(t) and recurrent processing R(t). Similarly, in post-traumatic stress disorder, the parameters of emotional modulation E(t), adaptability A(t), and temporal characteristics T(t) may be affected [16, 46].

Thus, according to the EIRM theory, the features of conscious experience in various mental disorders may be related to imbalances in the components determining emergent integrated information Φₑ.

#### 6.2. Use of the Φₑ Metric in Diagnosing Consciousness Disorders

According to the extended Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), the quantitative assessment of the emergent integrated information parameter Φₑ can be used as a diagnostic criterion for consciousness disorders.

Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that patients with various consciousness disorders, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state, exhibit a significant reduction in Φₑ compared to healthy subjects [46, 47].

In the study by Casali et al. (2013) [46], a method for calculating Φₑ based on EEG data was developed. The authors found that Φₑ was significantly reduced in patients in a vegetative state compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001). Moreover, the degree of reduction in Φₑ correlated with clinical assessments of consciousness levels.

Similar results were obtained in the study by Sitt et al. (2014) [47], where fMRI data showed that Φₑ predicted the level of consciousness with high accuracy (AUC = 0.92). The authors concluded that disruptions in information integration in recurrent neural networks are a key mechanism of consciousness disorders.

Thus, the use of the Φₑ metric proposed within the EIRM theory can serve as an objective diagnostic criterion for assessing the level of consciousness and identifying disruptions in information integration and recurrent processes in various clinical conditions.

#### 6.3. Therapeutic Potential of the EIRM Theory

According to the extended Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM), imbalances in emotional and cognitive processes observed in various mental disorders can significantly affect the parameters characterizing conscious experience. The development of new therapeutic strategies should consider the need to correct the imbalance between these parameters.

Therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring balance in the parameters of the EIRM theory may include:

1. Methods affecting neurotransmitter systems:
   - Correcting serotonin (5-HT) deficiency in depression to normalize the emotional modulation parameter E(t) [21].
   - Regulating increased norepinephrine (NE) activity in anxiety disorders to restore the balance of E(t) and R(t) [32].
   - Restoring the balance of the cholinergic system (acetylcholine, ACh) to correct disruptions in emotional modulation E(t) and recurrent processing R(t) [27, 28].

2. Psychotherapeutic techniques:
   - Cognitive-behavioral therapy to correct the imbalance between emotional and cognitive components [49].
   - Exposure therapy to restore adaptability A(t) and normalize E(t) [49].
   - Biofeedback-based techniques to train control over emotional reactions and their integration [50].

Comprehensive approaches, including both pharmacological correction and psychotherapeutic methods, may be most effective in restoring balanced interactions between emotional and cognitive processes in mental disorders.

Thus, the EIRM theory provides a theoretical basis for developing new therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting disruptions in information integration and recurrent processing mechanisms underlying consciousness disorders and mental illnesses.

### Appendix: Comparison with Existing Theories


![Intersections between EIRM theory and other theories](/table.svg "Comparative table of consciousness theories")

More details: [Comparative Analysis of Leading Theories of Consciousness](/comparative-analysis.md)


In this section, we compare the Theory of Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping (EIRM) with several existing theories of consciousness. We highlight similarities and differences and provide references to studies supporting these comparisons.

#### Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

**Similarities**:

The Global Workspace Theory (GWT), proposed by Bernard Baars, emphasizes the importance of information integration for the emergence of conscious experience. According to GWT, information becomes conscious when it is accessible to the global workspace, allowing different parts of the brain to exchange data and coordinate actions.

- Both approaches recognize that information integration is a key element of consciousness.

- The importance of global neural coordination for conscious perception is emphasized.

**Differences**:

- Emergence and Recurrence: EIRM emphasizes emergent properties arising from recurrent neural processes. While GWT focuses on the global availability of information, EIRM asserts that recurrent connections and the complex dynamics of neural networks play a crucial role in the emergence of consciousness.

- Integration Mechanisms: EIRM suggests that it is not just the dissemination of information but recurrent processing and integration at different levels of the neural network that lead to emergent conscious experience.

**References**:

   - Description: A foundational work in which Baars presents GWT, explaining how the global workspace facilitates information integration and consciousness.

   - Journal: *Cognition*, 79(1-2), 1–37.

   - Description: The article expands on GWT, discussing the neural correlates of consciousness and the role of the global workspace in information integration.

#### Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**Similarities**:

The Integrated Information Theory (IIT), developed by Giulio Tononi, asserts that consciousness corresponds to the system's ability to integrate information. IIT introduces the measure of integrated information Φ (phi), which quantitatively assesses the level of consciousness.

- Both approaches use the concept of information integration as a central element of consciousness.

- It is recognized that highly integrated systems are capable of richer conscious experiences.

**Differences**:

- Φₑ Metric and Recurrence: EIRM introduces the Φₑ metric, which considers not only the degree of integration but also the recurrence of neural connections, i.e., the cyclic pathways of information processing in the brain.

- Emergent Properties: While IIT focuses on the quantitative assessment of integration in static systems, EIRM emphasizes the dynamic and emergent properties of consciousness arising from constantly changing recurrent interactions in the neural network.

   - Journal: *PLoS Computational Biology*, 10(5), e1003588.

   - Description: An extended version of IIT, discussing the mathematical foundations of the theory and its applicability to various systems.


#### Predictive Coding Theory

**Similarities**:

The Predictive Coding Theory asserts that the brain constantly generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates its models of the world based on received information. This theory emphasizes the role of predictions and minimizing prediction errors in information processing.

- Both approaches recognize the importance of prediction and updating internal models in neural processes.

- The active role of the brain in forming perception, rather than just passive processing of stimuli, is emphasized.

**Differences**:

- Integration with Recurrent Processing: EIRM integrates the concepts of predictive coding with information integration and recurrent processing, offering a more comprehensive approach. While predictive coding theory may focus on hierarchical models and the flow of information top-down and bottom-up, EIRM asserts that recurrent connections and their dynamics ensure emergent consciousness.

- Holistic Approach: EIRM aims to combine various aspects of neural activity—prediction, integration, and recurrence—to explain how conscious experience arises, while predictive coding theory may not consider all these elements together.
