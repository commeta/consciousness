# New Types of Particles and Interactions Predicted by the Recurrent Cosmology Model

## Introduction

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, the high density of integrated quantum information (ρ_(IQI)) and the enhanced recurrence (R) in spacetime can lead to the stabilization of the existence of new, previously unknown elementary particles, as well as the emergence of fundamentally new types of interactions between particles. These predictions go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and open new perspectives for expanding our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter.

In this dissertation, we will examine in detail the mathematical description and the main characteristics of the new types of particles and interactions predicted by the recurrent cosmology model. Particular attention will be paid to the following key aspects:

1. Recurrons (ρ-particles): Theoretical justification for the existence of superheavy particles with spin 3/2, their mass, spin, and quantum characteristics.

2. Info-bosons (ι-particles): Description of massless particles that act as carriers of a new type of interaction - informational interaction.

3. Recurrent interaction: Mathematical representation of the Lagrangian describing a new type of interaction associated with recurrent processes in quantum systems.

4. Informational interaction: Formulation of the Hamiltonian responsible for the interaction mediated by informational fields and info-bosons.

5. Inclusion of new particles and interactions in existing theories: Consideration of the possibilities for integrating the predicted particles and interactions within the frameworks of supergravity and string theories.

6. Experimental approaches to verifying the predictions: Discussion of methods for direct search for new particles and indirect signs of new interactions in current and future experiments.

A comprehensive study of these aspects will not only deepen our understanding of elementary particle physics, but also assess the potential of the theory of recurrent cosmology as an extension of the Standard Model and an approximation to a unified theory of fundamental interactions.


### Predicted Particles

#### 1. Recurrons (ρ-particles)

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, the high density of integrated quantum information (ρ_(IQI)) and enhanced recurrence (R) in spacetime can stabilize the existence of new, previously unknown elementary particles, called recurrons (ρ-particles). The main characteristics of recurrons are:

Mass:

`mρ = √(ℏc/G) · α_r`

where α_r is the recurrence coupling constant. The expected mass of recurrons is around ~10¹⁹ GeV.

Spin:

The spin of recurrons is equal to 3/2.

Lifetime:

The lifetime of recurrons is estimated to be ~10⁻⁴⁴ s.

Quantum Numbers:

Recurrons are characterized by the following quantum numbers:

- Baryon number B = 0
- Lepton number L = 0
- Recurrence number R = 1

Thus, recurrons represent a new type of elementary particle predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology, possessing unique mass, spin, and quantum characteristics not observed within the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics.


#### 2. Info-bosons (ι-particles)

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, in addition to the predicted recurrons, the model also predicts the existence of a new type of elementary particles - info-bosons (ι-particles). The main characteristics of info-bosons are:

##### Properties of info-bosons

Carriers of informational interaction

Info-bosons act as carriers of a new type of interaction, called informational interaction, which is not described within the framework of the Standard Model.

Massless

Info-bosons are massless particles, which distinguishes them from other known fundamental particles.

Spin: 1

Info-bosons have a spin of 1, which corresponds to vector bosons.

New quantum number: informational charge I

In addition to the standard quantum numbers, info-bosons are characterized by a new quantum number - the informational charge I, reflecting their participation in the informational interaction.

##### Role of info-bosons

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, info-bosons play a key role in the transfer and interaction of integrated quantum information, which, according to the model, underlies the fundamental structure of the Universe. Their masslessness and spin 1 suggest that info-bosons may be analogous to photons, but responsible for a new type of interaction associated with quantum information.

The experimental detection and study of info-bosons will be an important confirmation of the predictions of the theory of recurrent cosmology and will expand our understanding of the fundamental interactions in nature.


### New Interactions

#### 1. Recurrent Interaction

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, one of the key predictions is the existence of a new type of interaction, called the recurrent interaction. This interaction can be described by the following Lagrangian:

`Lint = gR(ψ̄γμ∂νψ)Rμν`

Where:

- gR - the constant of recurrent coupling
- Rμν - the tensor of recurrence, characterizing the degree of recurrent processes in the system
- ψ - fermionic fields

Key features of the recurrent interaction:

1. New type of interaction: The recurrent interaction goes beyond the standard gauge or contact interactions described in the Standard Model of particle physics.

2. Role of recurrence: The tensor Rμν reflects the influence of recurrent processes, which according to the theory of recurrent cosmology play a key role in the dynamics of quantum systems.

3. Modification of particle dynamics: Inclusion of the recurrent interaction in the Lagrangian leads to a modification of the equations of motion for the fermionic fields ψ, which can affect the probabilities of production, decay, and scattering of elementary particles.

Experimental confirmation of the existence of the recurrent interaction, predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology, will be an important step in expanding the Standard Model of particle physics and approaching a unified theory of fundamental interactions.


#### 2. Informational Interaction

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, in addition to the recurrent interaction, the model also predicts the existence of informational interaction. This interaction is described by the following Hamiltonian:

`HI = ∑ᵢⱼ κᵢⱼ σᵢ†σⱼ + h.c.`

Where:

- κᵢⱼ - the matrix of informational coupling
- σᵢ - the operators of the informational field

##### Features of Informational Interaction

1. Carriers of the interaction: According to the theory, there are special particles called "info-bosons" (ι-particles) that act as the carriers of the informational interaction.

2. Masslessness: The info-bosons are predicted by the model to be massless particles.

3. Spin: The spin of the info-bosons is equal to 1.

4. New quantum number: The info-bosons are characterized by a new quantum number - the "informational charge" I.

##### Mathematical Description

The Hamiltonian of the informational interaction HI includes terms containing the operators of the informational field σᵢ and the matrix of informational coupling κᵢⱼ. This matrix determines the strength and nature of the informational interactions between the different components of the system.

Thus, the theory of recurrent cosmology predicts the existence of a fundamentally new type of interaction between elementary particles, mediated by informational fields and carriers - the info-bosons. Experimental confirmation of this prediction will be an important step in the expansion of modern particle physics.

### Connection with Existing Theories

#### Supergravity

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, the new types of particles and interactions can be incorporated into the supergravity theory as follows:

##### 1. Expansion of the Supermultiplet

In standard supergravity, the supermultiplet contains the graviton and gravitino:

`{graviton, gravitino}`

However, within the framework of the theory of recurrent cosmology, this supermultiplet should be expanded by including new particles:

`{graviton, gravitino, recurron, info-boson}`

Where:

- Recurrons (recurrons) - a new type of particle predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology, possessing a spin of 3/2 and a large mass of  10^19 GeV.
- Info-bosons (info-bosons) - massless particles that act as the mediators of the informational interaction.

Thus, the supergravity supermultiplet is expanded by including these new types of particles, which are associated with recurrent processes and integrated quantum information.

##### 2. Modified SUGRA Lagrangian

The supergravity Lagrangian (LSUGRA) must be supplemented with new terms accounting for the recurrent (LR) and informational (LI) interactions, as well as their mixing (Lmix):

`L = LSUGRA + LR + LI + Lmix`

Where:

- LR - the term describing the recurrent interaction, associated with the recurrence tensor Rμν.
- LI - the term describing the informational interaction, associated with the informational field operators σi.
- Lmix - the term responsible for the mixing of the standard and new fields.

Thus, the inclusion of additional terms related to recurrence and integrated quantum information modifies the standard supergravity Lagrangian, allowing for the incorporation of the new types of particles and interactions predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology.


#### String theory

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, new types of particles and interactions can be integrated into the framework of string theory as follows:

##### New string vibration modes

The theory of recurrent cosmology predicts the existence of two new types of string vibration modes:

###### R-modes (recurrent)

These vibration modes are associated with recurrent processes occurring in spacetime. They reflect the influence of integrated quantum information and recurrence on the dynamics of strings.

###### I-modes (informational)

In addition to the recurrent modes, the theory also predicts the existence of informational modes of string vibrations. These modes are responsible for interactions mediated by the informational fields predicted by the model of recurrent cosmology.

##### Modified consistency conditions

To account for the new types of vibration modes associated with recurrence and informational processes, string theory must be modified as follows:

`D = 10 + DR + DI`

Where:

- D - the standard number of dimensions in string theory (10)
- DR - additional dimensions related to recurrence
- DI - additional dimensions related to informational processes

Thus, the theory of recurrent cosmology proposes an expansion of the standard string theory by including new types of vibration modes and additional dimensions of spacetime. This opens up new possibilities for the unification of the concepts of recurrence, integrated quantum information, and string theory into a single consistent theoretical framework.


### Experimental Verification

Experimental confirmation of the predictions of the theory of recurrent cosmology regarding new types of particles and interactions will require:

#### 1. Direct search:


##### Next-generation detectors

The experimental detection of recurrons (ρ-particles) and info-bosons (ι-particles) predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology will require the use of next-generation detectors capable of registering particles with extremely high energies and unusual characteristics.

The main requirements for such detectors:

- High energy resolution for measuring the masses of super-heavy particles.
- Ability to detect particles with non-trivial spin states (spin 3/2 for recurrons).
- Sensitivity to signatures associated with new types of interactions, such as recurrent and informational interactions.
- High spatial resolution for track reconstruction and event topology.
- Ability to operate under conditions of extreme physical influences (high pressures, temperatures, magnetic fields).

Examples of next-generation detectors promising for the search for predicted particles:

- Hybrid detectors based on a combination of various technologies (calorimetry, tracking, Cherenkov counters).
- Detectors using superconducting materials to improve energy resolution.
- Multilayer detectors with high granularity for accurate event reconstruction.
- Detectors using new types of sensors (diamond, silicon, gas) for operation in extreme conditions.

The development and construction of such next-generation detectors is an important experimental task for verifying the predictions of the theory of recurrent cosmology.


##### Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays

In addition to ground-based detectors, the search for the predicted particles can also be carried out by studying ultra-high energy cosmic rays.

Key features:

- Cosmic rays may contain traces of recurrons and info-bosons, formed as a result of astrophysical processes.
- The energies of cosmic rays can reach values comparable to the masses of the predicted particles.
- Analysis of energy spectra, chemical composition, and event topologies in cosmic rays may reveal signatures of new types of particles and interactions.

Main experimental approaches:

- Utilization of hybrid detectors, located on Earth and in space, for the registration of cosmic ray particles.
- Application of track and cascade reconstruction methods to identify signatures of the predicted particles.
- Analysis of anomalies in energy spectra and chemical composition of cosmic rays.

Successful detection of traces of recurrons, info-bosons, or their interactions in cosmic rays would be an important confirmation of the predictions of the recurrent cosmology theory.

##### Gravitational Wave Detectors

The recurrent cosmology theory suggests that recurrent processes and integrated quantum information can influence the dynamics of space-time. This opens up the possibility of searching for signatures of the predicted particles and interactions using gravitational wave detectors.

Main research directions:

- Search for anomalies in gravitational wave signals that may be associated with recurrent effects in astrophysical processes.
- Analysis of the spectral characteristics of gravitational waves, which may reflect the influence of integrated quantum information on the geometry of space-time.
- Investigation of correlations between gravitational wave signals and other astrophysical observations, which may indicate the presence of new types of interactions.

Promising gravitational wave detectors:

- Next-generation detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, with improved sensitivity.
- Space-based interferometers, such as LISA, capable of detecting gravitational waves on larger scales.
- Networks of ground-based and space-based detectors to improve the accuracy of source localization and signal analysis.

Successful detection of signatures related to recurrent effects and integrated quantum information in the data from gravitational wave detectors would be an important experimental confirmation of the predictions of the recurrent cosmology theory.

#### 2. Indirect Signatures:

##### Anomalies in Decays of Heavy Particles

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, the emergence of new types of particles, such as recurrons and info-bosons, as well as new interactions, can lead to anomalies in the decays of heavy particles observed in collider experiments.

For example, the recurrent interaction described by the Lagrangian Lint = gR(ψ̄γμ∂νψ)Rμν can open up additional decay channels for heavy hadrons or leptons. The probabilities of such rare decays, not predicted by the Standard Model, can be significantly increased due to the contribution of recurrent effects.

The experimental search and analysis of anomalies in the decay spectra of heavy particles will be an important direction for the indirect detection of signatures of new interactions predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology.

##### Violation of CPT Symmetry

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, new types of interactions, such as the informational interaction HI = ∑ᵢⱼ κᵢⱼ σᵢ†σⱼ + h.c., can lead to the violation of the fundamental CPT symmetry.

This is because recurrent processes and integrated quantum information can contribute to effective Lagrangians containing terms that violate CPT invariance. Such violations can manifest in various physical observables, including:

- Differences in the properties of particles and antiparticles
- Asymmetries in the decay rates of particles and antiparticles
- Deviations from the equality of masses of particles and antiparticles

Experimental studies at high-precision colliders and in astrophysical observations can reveal evidence of CPT symmetry violation, which would become an important indirect confirmation of the predictions of the theory of recurrent cosmology.

##### Quantum Effects in Macroscopic Systems

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, integrated quantum information and recurrent processes can manifest not only at the microscopic level of elementary particles, but also in macroscopic quantum systems.

For example, recurrent interactions can lead to the emergence of collective quantum states in condensed matter systems, such as superconductors, superfluids, or Bose-Einstein condensates. The observation of unusual quantum effects in such macroscopic systems may serve as indirect evidence of the influence of recurrence and integrated quantum information.

Moreover, recurrent processes can modify quantum correlations and entanglement in macroscopic quantum systems, which can be detected in experiments on quantum teleportation, quantum cryptographic key distribution, or quantum computing.

Experimental studies of quantum effects in macroscopic systems, going beyond the standard predictions of quantum mechanics, will become an important direction for the indirect search for signatures of new interactions predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology.


### Theoretical Predictions

#### 1. Mass Spectrum

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, new types of particles, such as recurrons (ρ-particles), should have a mass spectrum that can be described by the following expression:

`M(n,l) = M₀√(n² + l(l+1)αR)`

Where:

- M(n,l) - the mass of a particle with the principal quantum number n and the recurrent quantum number l
- M₀ - the base mass of the particle
- αR - a constant characterizing the recurrent structure of the system

Key features:

1. The principal quantum number n determines the main contribution to the particle's mass.
2. The recurrent quantum number l introduces an additional contribution related to recurrent effects.
3. The constant αR reflects the degree of influence of recurrence on the mass spectrum of the particles.

Thus, the theory of recurrent cosmology predicts that the masses of new types of particles will depend not only on their basic quantum numbers, but also on the parameters characterizing the recurrent processes in the system.

#### 2. Interaction Cross-Sections

The theory of recurrent cosmology also predicts that the cross-sections of interactions involving the new types of particles will have the following form:

`σ(s) = σ₀(1 + βR ln²(s/s₀))`

Where:

- σ(s) - the interaction cross-section as a function of the center-of-mass energy s
- σ₀ - the baseline interaction cross-section
- βR - a coefficient characterizing the influence of recurrence
- s₀ - a characteristic energy scale

Key features:

1. The interaction cross-section contains an additional factor that depends on the recurrence parameter R.
2. This dependence has a logarithmic character, becoming stronger at high energies s.
3. The coefficient βR determines the degree of influence of recurrence on the interaction cross-section.

Thus, the theory of recurrent cosmology predicts that the interaction cross-sections involving the new types of particles will exhibit anomalous energy dependencies, associated with the recurrent effects in the system.

Experimental confirmation of these theoretical predictions will be an important step in the verification of the recurrent cosmology model and the expansion of modern elementary particle physics.


### Open Questions

#### The Hierarchy of Masses Problem

One of the key problems that the theory of recurrent cosmology must solve is the explanation of the origin and hierarchy of masses of elementary particles, including both the known particles of the Standard Model and the new types of particles, such as the predicted recurrons and info-bosons.

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, the density of integrated quantum information (ρ_(IQI)) and the recurrence parameter (R) should have a significant influence on the mechanisms of particle mass generation. It is necessary to develop specific mathematical models that relate these information parameters to the mass characteristics of elementary particles.

One possible approach is to modify the Higgs mechanism, which is the basis for mass generation in the Standard Model. The theory of recurrent cosmology suggests that additional terms dependent on ρ_(IQI) and R can contribute to the masses of particles, in addition to the standard contribution from the interaction with the Higgs field:

`m = g v + α ρ_(IQI) v + β R v`

Where m is the particle mass, g is the Yukawa coupling constant in the Standard Model, v is the Higgs field vacuum expectation value, and α and β are coefficients characterizing the influence of ρ_(IQI) and R, respectively.

Furthermore, the theory of recurrent cosmology predicts the appearance of new types of interactions mediated by ρ_(IQI) and R, which can lead to previously unknown mechanisms of mass generation. These new mechanisms must be investigated and compared with experimental data on the masses of elementary particles.

Mathematically, such new mechanisms can be described as follows:

`m = g v + α ρ_(IQI) v + β R v + γ ρ_(IQI) R v`

Where γ is an additional coefficient responsible for the combined influence of ρ_(IQI) and R on particle masses.

Solving the problem of the mass hierarchy within the framework of the theory of recurrent cosmology will require a careful analysis of experimental data obtained at modern colliders, as well as the development of extended theoretical models capable of quantitatively describing the influence of information parameters on the mass characteristics of elementary particles. Successful explanation of the origin of masses and their hierarchy will be an important step towards the construction of a unified theory of fundamental interactions.


#### Mechanism of Recurrent Symmetry Breaking

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, in addition to the standard gauge symmetries of the Standard Model, new recurrent symmetries should be present in elementary particle physics. These symmetries are associated with recurrent processes, described by the recurrence parameter R, and the integrated quantum information, characterized by the density ρ_(IQI).

Mathematically, the recurrent symmetries can be represented as an extended gauge group:

`G = G₀ ⊗ GR`

Where G₀ is the standard gauge group of the Standard Model, and GR is the group of recurrent transformations. The generators of this group will have the form:

```
[T_a, T_b] = i f_abc T_c
[R_a, R_b] = i g_abc R_c
[T_a, R_b] = i h_abc S_c
```

Here, T_a and R_a are the generators of the standard and recurrent transformations, respectively, and S_c are the generators of the mixed transformations.

However, according to the theory, these recurrent symmetries must undergo spontaneous breaking, leading to the appearance of masses and interactions of new particles, such as recurrons and info-bosons.

The mechanism of spontaneous breaking of recurrent symmetry can be described as follows:

1. Introduction of a recurrent scalar field Φ_R, analogous to the Higgs field in the Standard Model:

   `V(Φ_R) = μ_R² |Φ_R|² + λ_R |Φ_R|⁴`

   Where μ_R² < 0 and λ_R > 0 are the potential parameters.

2. Spontaneous breaking of the recurrent symmetry due to the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the field Φ_R⁰:

   `⟨Φ_R⟩ = Φ_R⁰ ≠ 0`

3. Generation of masses of recurrent particles due to their interaction with the Φ_R field:

   ```
   m_ρ = g_ρ Φ_R⁰
   m_ι = g_ι Φ_R⁰
   ```

   Where g_ρ and g_ι are the coupling constants of the recurrent and informational particles with the Φ_R field, respectively.

Thus, the spontaneous breaking of the recurrent symmetry, analogous to the Higgs mechanism, leads to the appearance of masses of new types of particles predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology. Further study of this mechanism, its connection with integrated quantum information and recurrence, is an important task for the development of this theory.


#### Quantum Quantization of the Information Field

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, in addition to the standard fields describing the fundamental interactions, there must exist a special information field in nature, responsible for new types of interactions, such as "information interaction". For a consistent description of these phenomena, it is necessary to develop a quantum theory of the information field, consistent with the general structure of the theory of recurrent cosmology.

##### Mathematical Description of the Information Field

Let us introduce the information field operator σ(x), which will characterize the density of integrated quantum information at the point of space-time x. The Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the information field can be represented as:

`H_I = ∑_ij κ_ij σ_i† σ_j + h.c.`

Where κ_ij is the matrix of information connections between the various degrees of freedom of the σ field.

##### Quantization of the Information Field

To quantize the information field, it is necessary to introduce canonical commutation relations:

```
[σ_i(x), σ_j†(y)] = δ_ij δ(x-y)
[σ_i(x), σ_j(y)] = 0
```

This will allow the construction of the creation and annihilation operators of information quanta - "info-bosons".

##### Interaction with Other Fields

The information field must interact with other fields describing the standard fundamental interactions. This can be taken into account by adding terms of the form to the Lagrangian:

`L_int = g_i ψ̄ σ ψ`

Where g_i are the coupling constants of the information interaction, and ψ are the fields of other particles.


##### Properties of info-bosons

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, info-bosons should have the following characteristics:

- Spin: 1
- Mass: 0 (massless)
- New quantum number: "information charge" I

Their role is to mediate the information interaction between particles.

##### Inclusion in unified theories

The quantum theory of the information field must be consistent with extended theories such as supergravity theory and string theory. This can be achieved, for example, by:

1. Expanding the supermultiplet to include info-bosons:

graviton, gravitino → graviton, gravitino, recurron, info-boson

2. Modifying the matching conditions in string theory:

`D = 10 + D_R + D_I`

Where D_R, D_I are additional dimensions related to recurrence and the information field, respectively.

##### Experimental manifestations

The experimental detection of info-bosons and their interactions will require:

1. Searching for signatures in collider processes, such as:

   - Cascade decays involving info-bosons
   - Observation of "missing" energy

2. Studying ultra-high energy cosmic rays, which may contain traces of information interactions.

3. Analyzing possible violations of CPT symmetry related to the information field.


##### Conclusions

The development of a quantum theory of the information field is an important task for the consistent description of the new types of particles and interactions predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology. The successful construction of such a theory and its experimental confirmation could lead to a significant expansion of modern elementary particle physics and fundamental interactions.

#### Topological aspects of new interactions

According to the theory of recurrent cosmology, in addition to the standard fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, strong, weak, gravitational), there may exist new types of interactions in nature associated with recurrent processes and integrated quantum information. These "recurrent" and "informational" interactions may have a non-trivial topological structure, which opens up new possibilities for understanding the fundamental laws of physics.

##### Topological invariants of recurrent interactions</b>

To describe the topological properties of recurrent interactions, one can introduce special topological invariants. One such invariant may be:

`I_R = ∫_M Tr(F ∧ F ∧ R)`

Where:

- F - the field strength tensor of the recurrent gauge field
- R - the recurrence tensor of spacetime
- M - the manifold on which the recurrent interactions are defined

This invariant characterizes the topological properties of recurrent structures and can be related to the quantum numbers and coupling constants of the new interactions.

##### Soliton solutions of recurrent equations</b>

Recurrent interactions may allow the existence of non-trivial topological solutions, such as solitons. The equations of motion for recurrent fields may take the form:

`(□ + m^2)φ = g R(φ)`

Where R(φ) is a nonlinear term responsible for recurrent effects. Such equations may admit soliton solutions of the form:

`φ_s(x) = φ_0 tanh(x/√λ_R)`

Where λ_R is a constant characterizing the recurrence. These soliton configurations will have non-trivial topology and may play the role of "carrier particles" of recurrent interactions.

##### Topological Effects in Informational Interactions

The informational interactions predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology may also have a non-trivial topological structure. The Hamiltonian of the informational interaction can be written in the form:

`H_I = ∑_ij κ_ij σ_i† σ_j + h.c.`

Where σ_i are the operators of the informational field, and κ_ij is the matrix of informational couplings. This matrix may have a non-trivial topology, leading to the appearance of special topological excitations.

Furthermore, informational interactions may be related to the topological properties of the space-time modified by the integrated quantum information. Studying this connection may shed light on the fundamental nature of information in physics.

##### Experimental Manifestations of Topological Effects

The experimental detection of topological effects associated with recurrent and informational interactions represents a serious experimental challenge. Possible manifestations may include:

- Observation of non-trivial topological excitations (solitons, vortices) in particle scattering processes
- Measurement of topological invariants, such as I_R, in high-energy experiments
- Search for manifestations of the topological structure of informational interactions in quantum experiments

Successful experimental detection of topological effects predicted by the theory of recurrent cosmology will be an important step in understanding the fundamental nature of these new types of interactions.

##### Conclusions

The study of the topological aspects of recurrent and informational interactions is an important task for the further development of the theory of recurrent cosmology. The introduction of special topological invariants, the analysis of soliton solutions, and the study of the connection with the topology of space-time can shed light on the structure of these new types of fundamental interactions. Experimental confirmation of topological effects will be an important step towards the expansion of modern elementary particle physics.
