| Abstract

Consciousness is one of the most enigmatic and complex phenomena, attracting the attention of scientists from various fields such as neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in understanding the brain and cognitive processes, the nature of consciousness and the mechanisms of its emergence remain poorly understood.

This work presents the Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM), which offers an integrative approach to understanding consciousness. The theory is based on the concept of emergence, arguing that consciousness is an inherent property of complex neural systems, arising from the dynamic interaction of its components. Key elements of the theory include:
