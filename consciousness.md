# Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM)

| Abstract

Consciousness is one of the most enigmatic and complex phenomena, attracting the attention of scientists from various fields such as neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in understanding the brain and cognitive processes, the nature of consciousness and the mechanisms of its emergence remain poorly understood.

This work presents the Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM), which offers an integrative approach to understanding consciousness. The theory is based on the concept of emergence, arguing that consciousness is an inherent property of complex neural systems, arising from the dynamic interaction of its components. Key elements of the theory include:



1. Information Integration: The brain integrates diverse sensory and cognitive information, creating a unified perception of the world.

2. Recurrent Processing: Recurrent neural networks and feedback loops play a critical role in maintaining and updating information necessary for consciousness.

3. Predictive Coding: The brain constantly generates predictions about incoming information, using prediction errors to adapt and learn.

4. Role of Attention and Working Memory: Mechanisms of attention and working memory modulate the processes of integration and recurrent processing, highlighting relevant information for conscious perception.

The EIRM theory aims to integrate existing models and data from neurobiological research into a unified conceptual framework. It offers an explanation of how complex neural processes lead to the emergence of subjective experience, and opens new perspectives for research in the field of consciousness.

1. The Problem of Consciousness in Modern Science

Consciousness is a central object of study in neuroscience, psychology, philosophy of mind, and related disciplines. Despite extensive research, the question of how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience remains unanswered. This problem, known as the “hard problem of consciousness” in the words of philosopher David Chalmers, generates numerous discussions and controversies.


1.1. Existing Approaches to Studying Consciousness

   - Global Workspace Theory (GWT):
       - Proposes a model where consciousness arises when information becomes globally available to different cognitive systems.
       - Highlights the role of information dissemination throughout the brain.

   - Integrated Information Theory (IIT):
       - Argues that consciousness is linked to a quantifiable measure of integrated information in a system, denoted as Phi (Φ).
       - Focuses on the structure and complexity of informational connections in neural networks.

   - Predictive Coding:
       - Views the brain as a hierarchical system constantly predicting sensory inputs and updating its models based on prediction errors.
       - Emphasizes the role of learning and adaptation in perception.

   - Recurrent Processing:
       - Points to the importance of feedback loops and recurrent connections in the brain for maintaining and processing information.
       - Links consciousness to cyclical information processing.
