# Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM)

| Abstract

Consciousness is one of the most enigmatic and complex phenomena, attracting the attention of scientists from various fields such as neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in understanding the brain and cognitive processes, the nature of consciousness and the mechanisms of its emergence remain poorly understood.

This work presents the Emergent Integration and Recurrent Mapping Theory (EIRM), which offers an integrative approach to understanding consciousness. The theory is based on the concept of emergence, arguing that consciousness is an inherent property of complex neural systems, arising from the dynamic interaction of its components. Key elements of the theory include:



1. Information Integration: The brain integrates diverse sensory and cognitive information, creating a unified perception of the world.

2. Recurrent Processing: Recurrent neural networks and feedback loops play a critical role in maintaining and updating information necessary for consciousness.

3. Predictive Coding: The brain constantly generates predictions about incoming information, using prediction errors to adapt and learn.

4. Role of Attention and Working Memory: Mechanisms of attention and working memory modulate the processes of integration and recurrent processing, highlighting relevant information for conscious perception.

The EIRM theory aims to integrate existing models and data from neurobiological research into a unified conceptual framework. It offers an explanation of how complex neural processes lead to the emergence of subjective experience, and opens new perspectives for research in the field of consciousness.

| Introduction

1. The Problem of Consciousness in Modern Science

Consciousness is a central object of study in neuroscience, psychology, philosophy of mind, and related disciplines. Despite extensive research, the question of how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience remains unanswered. This problem, known as the “hard problem of consciousness” in the words of philosopher David Chalmers, generates numerous discussions and controversies.


1.1. Existing Approaches to Studying Consciousness

   - Global Workspace Theory (GWT):
       - Proposes a model where consciousness arises when information becomes globally available to different cognitive systems.
       - Highlights the role of information dissemination throughout the brain.

   - Integrated Information Theory (IIT):
       - Argues that consciousness is linked to a quantifiable measure of integrated information in a system, denoted as Phi (Φ).
       - Focuses on the structure and complexity of informational connections in neural networks.

   - Predictive Coding:
       - Views the brain as a hierarchical system constantly predicting sensory inputs and updating its models based on prediction errors.
       - Emphasizes the role of learning and adaptation in perception.

   - Recurrent Processing:
       - Points to the importance of feedback loops and recurrent connections in the brain for maintaining and processing information.
       - Links consciousness to cyclical information processing.

1.2. The Need for an Integrative Theory

Existing models offer valuable insights into consciousness, but often consider it from a single perspective, overlooking the complexity of interactions within the brain. For example:

   - GWT emphasizes information dissemination but doesn’t sufficiently explain how this information is integrated and experienced consciously.
   - IIT provides a quantitative measure of consciousness but struggles to explain dynamic processes and the role of recurrence.
   - Predictive coding focuses on sensory processing and learning, but doesn’t encompass all aspects of subjective experience.

Therefore, there is a need for an integrative theory that combines key elements of these approaches, creating a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of consciousness.

## Core Principles of the EIRM Theory
### 1. Emergence of Consciousness

Definition of Emergence: Emergence is the appearance of new properties or qualities in a complex system that cannot be predicted or explained solely based on the properties of individual components.

#### Consciousness as an Emergent Property:

   - Consciousness is not the result of the activity of individual neurons or even individual brain areas.
   - It arises from the complex dynamics of interactions between different neural networks and systems.
   - The collective activity of neurons, their synchronization, and coordination lead to the emergence of subjective experience.

#### Examples of Emergence in Neural Networks:

   - Synchronization of neuronal oscillations: Collective waves of activity, such as gamma rhythms, are not inherent to individual neurons, but arise from their interactions.
   - Processing of images and concepts: High-level representations, such as concepts or abstract ideas, emerge from the interaction of multiple neural circuits.

### 2. Information Integration
#### The Necessity of Integration:

   - For a unified perception of the world, the brain must integrate information from various sensory channels and cognitive processes.
   - Integration allows disparate information to be connected, creating a comprehensive and coherent experience.

#### Integration Mechanisms

Functional connections between brain areas: Neural pathways connecting different regions, such as visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices.

##### Global Workspace:


   - The concept of a global workspace suggests that consciousness arises when information becomes accessible to multiple cognitive processes through a widely distributed network.
   - Integrated information is broadcast throughout this network, allowing various cognitive systems to utilize it simultaneously.

#### Metric of Integrated Information:

Phi (Φ): A measure of the amount of integrated information in a system.

Phi-emergence (Φₑ):

Φₑ = ∫[](t₀)^(t₁) (( I_(integration)(t) × R_(recurrence)(t) )) dt

Here, I_(integration)(t) quantifies the degree of information integration at time t .


### 3. Recurrent Processing and Prediction
#### Role of Recurrent Connections:

   - Recurrent Networks: Networks where the output signals of neurons influence their own inputs or the inputs of previous layers.
   - Maintaining Activity: Recurrent connections allow information to be maintained in an active state, which is crucial for conscious perception and working memory.

#### Predictive Coding:

   - The Brain as a Predictor:
       - The brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs based on past experiences and internal models of the world.
       - Predictions allow for rapid and efficient processing of information by focusing on crucial changes.

   - Prediction Errors:
       - The difference between the prediction and the actual sensory input is called a prediction error.
       - Prediction errors are used to update internal models through learning and adaptation processes.

   - Bayesian Update:

P(θ | D) = P(D | θ) P(θ) / P(D)

P(θ | D) — the posterior probability of hypothesis θ after receiving data D .

> This approach models how the brain updates its predictions based on new data.



#### 4. The Role of Attention and Working Memory
##### Attention:

   - Selection Mechanisms: Attention allows for the selection of relevant information from a stream of sensory data for further processing.
   - Activity Modulation: Attention amplifies signals in relevant neural networks, increasing their contribution to conscious perception.

##### Working Memory:

   - Short-Term Information Retention: Working memory allows for the active maintenance of information for processing and decision-making.
   - Interaction with Recurrent Networks: Recurrent connections contribute to the sustained activity necessary for working memory.

#### 5. Dynamic Hierarchy of Neural Processes
##### Multi-level Processing:

   - The brain is organized hierarchically, from lower sensory areas to higher association regions.
   - Information is processed at different levels of complexity, from simple features to complex concepts.

##### Ascending and Descending Signals:

   - Ascending Pathways: Convey sensory information from receptors to higher areas.
   - Descending Pathways: Transmit predictions and modulate the activity of lower areas based on contextual information.

##### Role of Recurrence in the Hierarchy:

   - Recurrent connections link different levels, facilitating a continuous exchange of information and updating of predictions.


### Neurobiological Foundations of the Theory

The EIRM theory is supported by extensive neurobiological research data demonstrating the key role of information integration, recurrent connections, and predictive coding in brain function and consciousness.
